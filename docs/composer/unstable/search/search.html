        "category": "",
        "content": "Hyperledger Composer Access Control LanguageHyperledger Composer includes an access control language (ACL) that provides declarative access control over the elements of the domain model. By defining ACL rules you can determine which users/roles are permitted to create, read, update or delete elements in a business network&#39;s domain model.Network Access ControlHyperledger Composer differentiates between access control for resources within a business network (business access control) and access control for network administrative changes (network access control). Business access control and network access control are both defined in the access control file (.acl) for a business network.Network access control uses the system namespace, which is implicitly extended by all resources in a business network; and grants or denies access to specific actions as defined below, and is intended to allow for more nuanced access to certain network-level operations.What does network access control allow or disallow?Network access control affects the following CLI commands:Composer Networkcomposer network deployNetwork access is required to use the CREATE operation for registries and networks.composer network downloadNetwork access is required to use the READ operation for registries and networks.composer network listNetwork access is required to use the READ operation for registries and networks.composer network loglevelNetwork access is required to use the UPDATE operation for networks.composer network pingNetwork access is required to use the READ operation on registries and networks.composer network undeployNetwork access is required to use the DELETE operation on registries and networks.composer network updateNetwork access is required to use the UPDATE or CREATE operation on registries, or the UPDATE operation on networks.Composer Identitycomposer identity importNetwork access is required to use the UPDATE operation on identity registries or the CREATE operation on identities.composer identity issueNetwork access is required to use the UPDATE operation on identity registries or the CREATE operation on identities.composer identity revokeNetwork access is required to use the UPDATE operation on identity registries or the DELETE operation on identities.Composer Participantcomposer participant addNetwork access is required to use the CREATE operation on participants or the UPDATE operation on participant registries.Granting network access controlNetwork access is granted using the system namespace. The system namespace is always org.hyperledger.composer.system.Network for network access, and org.hyperledger.composer.system for all access. The following access control rules gives the networkControl participant the authority to use all operations with network commands.rule networkControlPermission {  description:  \"networkControl can access network commands\"  participant: \"org.acme.vehicle.auction.networkControl\"  operation: ALL  resource: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.Network\"  action: ALLOW  }The following access control rule will give all participants access to all operations and commands in the business network, including network access and business access.rule AllAccess {  description: \"AllAccess - grant everything to everybody\"  participant: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.Participant\"  operation: ALL  resource: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.**\"  action: ALLOW}Evaluation of Access Control RulesAccess control for a business network is defined by an ordered set of ACL rules. The rules are evaluated in order, and the first rule whose condition matches determines whether access is granted or denied. If no rule match then access is denied.ACL rules are defined in a file called permissions.acl in the root of the business network. If this file is missing from the business network then all access is permitted.Access Control Rule GrammarThere are two types of ACL rules: simple ACL rules and conditional ACL rules. Simple rules are used to control access to a namespace, asset or property of an asset by a participant type or participant instance.For example, the rule below states that any instance of the org.example.SampleParticipant type can perform ALL operations on all instances of org.example.SampleAsset.rule SimpleRule {    description: \"Description of the ACL rule\"    participant: \"org.example.SampleParticipant\"    operation: ALL    resource: \"org.example.SampleAsset\"    action: ALLOW}Conditional ACL rules introduce variable bindings for the participant and the resource being accessed, and a Boolean JavaScript expression, which, when true, can either ALLOW or DENY access to the resource by the participant.For example, the rule below states that any instance of the org.example.SampleParticipant type can perform ALL operations on all instances of org.example.SampleAsset IF the participant is the owner of the asset.rule SampleConditionalRule {    description: \"Description of the ACL rule\"    participant(m): \"org.example.SampleParticipant\"    operation: ALL    resource(v): \"org.example.SampleAsset\"    condition: (v.owner.getIdentifier() == m.getIdentifier())    action: ALLOW}Conditional ACL rules can also specify an optional transaction clause. When the transaction clause is specified, the ACL rule only allows access to the resource by the participant if the participant submitted a transaction, and that transaction is of the specified type.For example, the rule below states that any instance of the org.example.SampleParticipant type can perform ALL operations on all instances of org.example.SampleAsset IF the participant is the owner of the asset AND the participant submitted a transaction of the org.example.SampleTransaction type to perform the operation.rule SampleConditionalRuleWithTransaction {    description: \"Description of the ACL rule\"    participant(m): \"org.example.SampleParticipant\"    operation: READ, CREATE, UPDATE    resource(v): \"org.example.SampleAsset\"    transaction(tx): \"org.example.SampleTransaction\"    condition: (v.owner.getIdentifier() == m.getIdentifier())    action: ALLOW}Multiple ACL rules may be defined that conceptually define a decision table. The actions of the decision tree define access control decisions (ALLOW or DENY). If the decision table fails to match then by default access is denied.Resource defines the things that the ACL rule applies to. This can be a class, all classes within a namespace, or all classes under a namespace. It can also be an instance of a class.Resource Examples:Namespace: org.example.*Namespace (recursive): org.example.**Class in namespace: org.example.CarInstance of a class: org.example.Car#ABC123Operation identifies the action that the rule governs. Four actions are supported: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. You can use ALL to specify that the rule governs all supported actions. Alternatively, you can use a comma separated list to specify that the rule governs a set of supported actions.Participant defines the person or entity that has submitted a transaction for processing. If a Participant is specified they must exist in the Participant Registry. The PARTICIPANT may optionally be bound to a variable for use in a PREDICATE. The special value &#39;ANY&#39; may be used to denote that participant type checking is not enforced for a rule.Transaction defines the transaction that the participant must have submitted in order to perform the specified operation against the specified resource. If this clause is specified, and the participant did not submit a transaction of this type - for example, they are using the CRUD APIs - then the ACL rule does not allow access.Condition is a Boolean JavaScript expression over bound variables. Any JavaScript expression that is legal with the an if(...) expression may be used here. JavaScript expressions used for the condition of an ACL rule can refer to JavaScript utility functions in a script file. This allows a user to easily implement complex access control logic, and re-use the same access control logic functions across multiple ACL rules.Action identifies the action of the rule. It must be one of: ALLOW, DENY.ExamplesExample ACL rules (in evaluation order):rule R1 {    description: \"Fred can DELETE the car ABC123\"    participant: \"org.example.Driver#Fred\"    operation: DELETE    resource: \"org.example.Car#ABC123\"    action: ALLOW}rule R2 {    description: \"regulator with ID Bill can not update a Car if they own it\"    participant(r): \"org.example.Regulator#Bill\"    operation: UPDATE    resource(c): \"org.example.Car\"    condition: (c.owner == r)    action: DENY}rule R3 {    description: \"regulators can perform all operations on Cars\"    participant: \"org.example.Regulator\"    operation: ALL    resource: \"org.example.Car\"    action: ALLOW}rule R4 {    description: \"Everyone can read all resources in the org.example namespace\"    participant: \"ANY\"    operation: READ    resource: \"org.example.*\"    action: ALLOW}rule R5 {    description: \"Everyone can read all resources under the org.example namespace\"    participant: \"ANY\"    operation: READ    resource: \"org.example.**\"    action: ALLOW}Rules are evaluated from top (most specific) to bottom (least specific). As soon as the Participant, Operation and Resource match for a rule then subsequent rules are not evaluated.This ordering makes the decision table faster to scan for both humans and computers. If no ACL rule fires then the access control decision is DENY.",

The version number for the network should take the form Major.Minor.Micro andSemantic Versioning principles should be used when incrementing the version number.The identifier of the network is formed from its name, the - character and its version number. A valid identifier (and example) is therefore mybusinessnetwork-1.0.3.The metadata for a business network definition is read from package.json, meaning that business network definitions may also be valid npm packages.ModelsThe set of domain models for a business network definition define the types that are valid within the network and outside the network when it is integrated with external systems (for example systems that submit transactions to the network).A domain model may either be packaged within the business network definition (typically stored under the models directory), or may be declared in package.json as an external dependency. You refer to models via an npm dependency if you wanted to share them across business network definitions.ScriptsThe scripts for a business network definition are typically stored under the lib directory and are packaged within the business network definition. The scripts are written in ES 5 JavaScript and refer to the types that are defined in the domain models for the business network.Permissions.aclThe permissions for the business network expressed are expressed in an optional permissions.acl file.Cloning an Example Business Network DefinitionThe sample business network definitions are stored on GitHub at https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks.

        "content": "Deploying and Updating Business NetworksBefore a business network definition can be deployed it must be packaged into a Business Network Archive (.bna) file. The composer archive create command is used to create a business network archive file from a business network definition folder on disk.Once the business network archive file has been created it can be deployed to a runtime using the composer network deploy command using a suitable Connection Profile.For example:composer network deploy -p connectionProfileName -a &lt;BusinessNetworkDefinition&gt;.bna-i &lt;Your EnrollmentID&gt; -s &lt;Your EnrollmentSecret&gt;-A admin -STo update the business network definition for an already deployed business network use the composer network update CLI command.Deploying business networks to Hyperledger Fabric v1.0In Hyperledger Fabric v1.0, peers enforce the concepts of administrators and members (or users). Administrators have permission to install Hyperledger Fabric chaincode for a new business network onto peers. Members do not have permission to install chaincode. In order to deploy a business network to a set of peers, you must provide an identity that has administrative rights to all of those peers.To make that identity and its certificates available, your must import the identity into the credential store used by Hyperledger Composer. To import the identity, use the composer identity import command. When importing an identity, you do not assign it a secret, however the composer network deploy command requires a secret. If you are using an imported identity, you can enter any value for the secret, and it will be ignored.Hyperledger Composer provides a sample Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 network. The peer administrator for this network is called PeerAdmin, and the identity is automatically imported for you when you use the sample scripts for starting the network. Please note that the peer administrator may be given a different name for other Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 networks.Business network administratorsWhen you deploy a business network, access controls are enforced as per the access control rules specified in the business network definition. Each business network must have at least one participant, and that participant must have a valid identity for accessing the business network. Otherwise, client applications cannot interact with the business network.A business network administrator is a participant who is responsible for configuring the business network for their organisation after the business network is deployed, and is responsible for on-boarding other participants from their organisation. Because business networks include multiple organisations, there should be multiple business network administrators for any given business network.A built-in participant type, org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin, representing a business network administrator is provided by Hyperledger Composer. This built-in participant type does not have any special permissions; they are still subject to the access control rules specified in the business network definition. For this reason, it is recommended that you start with the following sample access control rules that grant business network administrators full access to a business network:rule NetworkAdminUser {    description: \"Grant business network administrators full access to user resources\"    participant: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin\"    operation: ALL    resource: \"**\"    action: ALLOW}rule NetworkAdminSystem {    description: \"Grant business network administrators full access to system resources\"    participant: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin\"    operation: ALL    resource: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.**\"    action: ALLOW}By default, Hyperledger Composer will automatically create a single business network administrator participant during deployment. The identity that is used for deploying the business network will also be bound to that business network administrator participant, so that identity can be used to interact with the business network after deployment.Hyperledger Fabric peer administrators may not have permission to issue new identities using the Hyperledger Fabric Certificate Authority (CA). This may restrict the ability of the business network administrator to on-board other participants from their organisation. For this reason, it may be preferable to create a business network administrator that does have permission to issue new identities using the Hyperledger Fabric Certificate Authority (CA).You can use additional options to the composer network deploy command to specify the business network administrators that should be created during the deployment of the business network.If the business network administrator has an enrollment ID and enrollment secret, you can use the -A (business network administrator) and -S (business network administrator uses enrollment secret) flags. For example, the following command will create a business network administrator for the existing admin enrollment ID:composer network deploy -p hlfv1 -a my-network.bna -i PeerAdmin -s randomString -A admin -SIf the business network administrator already has a certificate, you can use the -A (business network administrator) and -C (business network administrator certificate file) flags. For example, the following command will create a business network administrator for the specified certificate file:composer network deploy -p hlfv1 -a my-network.bna -i PeerAdmin -s randomString -A admin -C /path/to/admin.pemYou can also create multiple business network administrators by repeating the options. For example, the following command will create a business network administrator for all three of the specified certificate files:composer network deploy -p hlfv1 -a my-network.bna -i PeerAdmin -s randomString -A admin1 -C /path/to/admin1.pem -A admin2 -C /path/to/admin2.pem -A admin3 -C /path/to/admin3.pemDeploying business networks using Playground locallyWhen deploying a business network to Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 using the Playground locally, you must follow the process above to connect using the peer admin identity.Identities in playground are associated with business network cards, comprising a connection profile, identity metadata, and certificates.When deploying a business network using Playground locally, you must have at least one business network card with the PeerAdmin role and at least one business network card with the ChannelAdmin role. Each of these business network cards must contain the correct admin certificates.Errors deploying a business network to a local fabric using the Hyperledger Composer PlaygroundWhen deploying a business network to an instance of Hyperledger Fabric by using a locally installed Hyperledger Composer Playground, you may encounter the following error:Error: error trying to list instantiated chaincodes. Error: chaincode error (status 500, message: Authorization for GETCHAINCODES on channel getchaincodes has been denied with error Failed verifying that proposal's creator satisfies local MSP principal during channelless check policy with policy [Admins]:[This identity is not an admin])Once this error has occurred, you must delete your local browser storage to restore normal function.

        "content": "Publish Models or Business Network Definitions for use by applicationsHyperledger Composer can optionally use the npm package manager to publish both business networks, and models. By publishing business networks to npm applications that need to reference the business networks (for example to introspect them, or deploy them) can declare a binary package dependency on the published npm package. Using semantic versioning of the npm package for the business network also allows applications to specify their tolerance for accepting incompatible changes to the business network.The npm package manager is a powerful (Internet scale) mechanism to distribute any binaries, along with metadata expressed in a package.json file.Similarly, a set of Composer domain models (CTO files) may be packaged into an npm package for publication. The ability to publish models allows the models to be reused across multiple business networks (by declaring a package.json dependency), as well as ensures that semantic versioning can be used to control the evolution of the models themselves.However, publication to npm is not required to use Composer. You may bundle a business network inside an application, and simply manage its source files using version control software, such as git.The easiest way to publish a model or business network definition for use by applications it to push the business network definition to the npm package manager using the npm publish command. This will allow the applications that would like to use the business network definition (for example to deploy it via API) to reference the business network definition as a dependency in their package.json file.ReferencesExample business network published to npmExample model published to npm",

        "content": "Developing Business NetworksDevelopers use Hyperledger Composer to digitize business networks. The business network is accessed by multiple participants in the network, some of which may be responsible for the maintenance (hosting) of the network itself, referred to as maintainers of the network.Typically each maintainer of the network will run several peer nodes (for crash fault tolerance) and Hyperledger Fabric replicates the distributed ledger across the set of peer nodes.ModelDevelopers work with business analysts to define the domain data model for the business network. The data model is expressed using the Composer Modeling Language and defines the structure of the resources that will be stored on the ledger, or processed as transactions.Once the domain model is in place, developers can capture smart contracts as executable transaction processor functions, written in JavaScript.Access ControlIn parallel developers or technical analysts can define the access control rules for the business network, to enforce which participants have access to the data on the ledger and under which conditions.DeployDevelopers package the models, scripts and access control rules into a deployable Business Network Archive and use command line tools to deploy the archive to a runtime for testing.TestLike all business logic, it is important to create unit and system tests for business networks. Developers can use popular JavaScript testing frameworks such as Mocha and Chai to run unit tests (against the Node.js embedded runtime) or run system tests against a Hyperledger Fabric.IntegrateOnce the business network is tested and in place, front-end applications need to be created. Use the  REST Server to automatically generate a REST API for a business network, and then a skeleton generate Angular application using the Yeoman code generator.The REST Server can be configured to authenticate the participants in the business network, ensuring that credentials and permissions are enforced.ReferencesModeling LanguageAccess Control LanguageTransaction Processor Functions",

        "content": "Calling a REST API from Transaction Processor FunctionsThe status of this feature is experimental. We welcome your feedback on the utility of this feature. We may evolve the feature in the future to make it more generally useful. While we will strive to ensure backwards compatibility this cannot be guaranteed.ScenarioIn some cases it is desirable to be able to call REST APIs from transaction processor functions. This allows you to move complex computation off the blockchain. This allows the transaction processor functions to off-board complex or expensive computation to a centrally or peer hosted service.Calling an External REST ServiceThe post(url,data) function is available to transaction processor functions, allowing them to pass a concept, transaction, asset or participant to an external service. The data is serialized to JSON and the data is sent to the url using an HTTP POST using the application/json content encoding.Note that the post function is supported in all runtime environments: web (playground), Node.js (embedded) and HLF v1.0.Handling ResultsThe post method returns a Promise to a JS Object that contains the results returned by the remote server. The JS Object has the following properties:statusCode : the HTTP statusCodebody : the HTTP response bodyNote that HTTP response codes from 200 to 300 are returned as a resolved Promise, while any other response codes cause the Promise to be rejected. Rejected promises may be handled using a .catch Promise handler.The body property of the response is automatically converted to a JS Object if possible, otherwise it is returned as a string.Transaction processor functions may optionally call the getSerializer().fromJSON(object) function to convert a reponse body JS Object back into a Composer asset/participant/transaction.Examples/** * Handle a POST transaction, calling Node-RED running on Bluemix * @param {org.example.sample.PostTransaction} postTransaction - the transaction to be processed * @transaction * @return {Promise} a promise that resolves when transaction processing is complete */function handlePost(postTransaction) {    var url = 'https://composer-node-red.mybluemix.net/compute';    return post( url, postTransaction)      .then(function (result) {        // alert(JSON.stringify(result));          postTransaction.asset.value = 'Count is ' + result.body.sum;          return getAssetRegistry('org.example.sample.SampleAsset')          .then(function (assetRegistry) {              return assetRegistry.update(postTransaction.asset);          });      });}Idempotency and ConsensusThe result of the REST request should be a pure function (idempotent) to ensure that all peers get the same results with the same inputs. If this restriction is honored then the risk of consensus failure is minimised.Each peer will make a call to the REST service.CORSHTTP requests from the web browser will need to be CORS compliant. This requires the server be setup to receive the OPTIONS method and return appropriate headers.Docker Network ResolutionHTTP request from the HLF chain code container require DNS resolution and network are in place. For example, with the default Docker container one cannot use http://localhost as this does not resolve to the host machine inside the Docker container. The easiest workaround is to use a DNS name that is publicly resolvable.",

The directory must include a package.json in the root (used to specify the name, version and description of the business network). This method is designed to work with business networks that refer to external models using npm dependencies as well as business networks that statically package their model files.  If package.json contains a dependencies property then this method will search for model (CTO) files under the node_modules directory for each dependency that passes the options.dependencyGlob pattern.   If the network depends on an npm module its dependencies (transitive closure) will also be scanned for model (CTO) files.   The directory may optionally contain a README.md file which is accessible from the BusinessNetworkMetadata.getREADME method.

The directory must include a package.json in the root (used to specify the name, version and description of the business network). This method is designed to work with business networks that refer to external models using npm dependencies as well as business networks that statically package their model files.  If package.json contains a dependencies property then this method will search for model (CTO) files under the node_modules directory for each dependency that passes the options.dependencyGlob pattern.   If the network depends on an npm module its dependencies (transitive closure) will also be scanned for model (CTO) files.   The directory may optionally contain a README.md file which is accessible from the BusinessNetworkMetadata.getREADME method.   In addition all model files will be added that are not under node_modules and that pass the options.modelFileGlob pattern. By default you should put model files under a directory called &#39;models&#39;.   All script (js) files will be added that are not under node_modules and that pass the options.scriptGlob pattern. By default you should put Javascript files under the &#39;lib&#39; directory.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Hyperledger Composer Modeling LanguageHyperledger Composer includes an object-oriented modeling language that is used to define the domain model for a business network definition.A Hyperledger Composer CTO file is composed of the following elements:A single namespace. All resource declarations within the file are implicitly in this namespace.A set of resource definitions, encompassing assets, transactions, participants, and events.Optional import declarations that import resources from other namespaces.Organization and Hyperledger Composer System NamespacesYour organization namespace is defined in the namespace line of your model (.cto) file, and all resources created are implicitly part of this namespace.As well as defining new classes of asset, participant, event, and transaction, there is a system namespace which contains the base definitions of asset, event, participant, and transaction. These base definitions are abstract types which are implicitly extended by all assets, events, participants, and transactions.In the system namespace definitions, asset and participant have no required values. Events and transactions are defined by an eventId or transactionId and a timestamp. The system namespace also includes definitions of registries, historian records, identities, and a number of system transactions.If you have defined an event or transaction including an eventId, transactionId, or timestamp, you must delete the eventId, transactionId, or timestamp properties.Declarations of resourcesResources in Hyperledger Composer include:Assets, Participants, Transactions, and Events.Enumerated Types.Concepts.Assets, Participants and Transactions are class definitions. The concepts of Asset, Participant and Transaction may be considered to be different stereotypes of the class type.A class in Hyperledger Composer is referred to as a Resource Definition, therefore an asset instance has an Asset Definition.A resource definition has the following properties:A namespace defined by the namespace of its parent file. The namespace of a .cto file implicitly applies to all resources created in it.A name, for example Vehicle, and an identifying field, for example, vin. If the resource is an asset or participant, the name is followed by the identifying field, if the resource is an event or transaction, the identifying field is set automatically. In this example, the asset is named Vehicle and the identifying field is vin./** * A vehicle asset. */asset Vehicle identified by vin {  o String vin}An optional super-type, which the resource definition extends. The resource will take all properties and fields required by the super-type and add any additional properties or fields from its own definition./** * A car asset. A car is related to a list of parts */asset Car extends Vehicle {  o String model  --&gt; Part[] Parts}An optional &#39;abstract&#39; declaration, to indicate that this type cannot be created. Abstract resources can be used as a basis for other classes to extend. Extensions of abstract classes do not inherit the abstract status. For example, the asset Vehicle defined above should never be created, as there should be more specific asset classes defined to extend it./*** An abstract Vehicle asset.*/abstract asset Vehicle identified by vin {  o String vin}A set of named properties. The properties must be named, and the primitive data type defined.The properties and their data are owned by each resource, for example, a Car asset has a vin, and a model property, both of which are strings.A set of relationships to other Composer types that are not owned by the resource but that may be referenced from the resource. Relationships are unidirectional./**A Field asset. A Field is related to a list of animals*/asset Field identified by fieldId {o String fieldIdo String name--&gt; Animal[] animals}Declarations of enumerated typesEnumerated types are used to specify a type that may have 1 or N possible values. The example below defines the ProductType enumeration, which may have the value DAIRY or BEEF or VEGETABLES./*** An enumerated type*/enum ProductType {o DAIRYo BEEFo VEGETABLES}When another resource is created, for example, a participant, a property of that resource can be defined in terms of an enumerated type.participant Farmer identified by farmerId {    o String farmerId    o ProductType primaryProductConceptsConcepts are abstract classes that are not assets, participants or transactions. They are typically contained by an asset, participant or transaction.For example, below an abstract concept Address is defined, and then specialized into a UnitedStatesAddress. Note that concepts do not have an identified by field as they cannot be directly stored in registries or referenced in relationships.abstract concept Address {  o String street  o String city default =\"Winchester\"  o String country default = \"UK\"  o Integer[] counts optional}concept UnitedStatesAddress extends Address {  o String zipcode}Primitive typesComposer resources are defined in terms of the following primitive types:String: a UTF8 encoded String.Double: a double precision 64 bit numeric value.Integer: a 32 bit signed whole number.Long: a 64 bit signed whole number.DateTime: an ISO-8601 compatible time instance, with optional time zone and UTZ offset.Boolean: a Boolean value, either true or false.ArraysAll types in Composer may be declared as arrays using the [] notation.Integer[] integerArrayIs an array of Integers stored in a field called &#39;integerArray&#39;. While--&gt; Animal[] incomingIs an array of relationships to the Animal type, stored in a field called&#39;incoming&#39;.RelationshipsA relationship in the Composer language is a tuple composed of:The namespace of the type being referencedThe type name of the type being referencedThe identifier of the instance being referencedHence a relationship could be to:    org.example.Vehicle#123456This would be a relationship to the Vehicle type declared in the org.examplenamespace with the identifier 123456.Relationships are unidirectional and deletes do not cascade, ie. removing the relationship has no impact on the thing that is being pointed to. Removing the thing being pointed to does not invalidate the relationship.Relationships must be resolved to retrieve an instance of the object beingreferenced. The act of resolution may result in null, if the object no longerexists or the information in the relationship is invalid.Field ValidatorsString fields may include an optional regular expression, which is used to validate the contents of the field. Careful use of field validators allows Composer to perform rich data validation, leading to fewer errors and less boilerplate code.The example below declares that the Farmer participant contains a field postcode that must conform to the regular expression for valid UK postcodes.participant Farmer extends Participant {    o String firstName default=\"Old\"    o String lastName default=\"McDonald\"    o String address1    o String address2    o String county    o String postcode regex=/(GIR 0AA)|((([A-Z-[QVf]][0-9][0-9]?)|(([A-Z-[QVf]][A-Z-[IJZ]][0-9][0-9]?)|(([A-Z-[QVf]][0-9][A-HJKPSTUW])|([A-Z-[QVf]][A-Z-[IJZ]][0-9][ABEHMNPRVWfY])))) [0-9][A-Z-[CIKMOV]]{2})/}Double, Long or Integer fields may include an optional range expression, which is used to validate the contents of the field.The example below declared that the Vehicle asset has an Integer field year which defaults to 2016 and must be 1990, or higher.

Alternatively use the .* notation to import all the types from another namespace.import org.example.MyAssetimport org.example2.*DecoratorsResources and properties of resources may have decorators attached. Decorators are used to annotate a model with metadata. The example below adds the foo decorator to the Buyer participant, with &quot;arg1&#39; and 2 passed as arguments to the decorator.Similarly decorators can be attached to properties, relationships and enumerated values.@foo(\"arg1\", 2)participant Buyer extends Person {}Resource definitions and properties may be decorated with 0 or more decorations. Note that only a single instance of a decorator is allowed on each element type. I.e. it is invalid to have the @bar decorator listed twice on the same element.Decorator ArgumentsDecorators may have an arbitrary list of arguments (0 or more items). Argument values must be strings, numbers or booleans.Decorator APIsDecorators are accessible at runtime via the ModelManager introspect APIs. This allows external tools and utilities to use the Composer Modelling Language (CTO) file format to describe a core model, while decorating it with sufficient metadata for their own purposes.The example below retrieves the 3rd argument to the foo decorator attached to the myField property of a class declaration:const val = myField.getDecorator('foo').getArguments()[2];",

        "content": "Deploying the REST server for a business networkWhen deploying the Hyperledger Composer REST server in a production environment, for example using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, the REST server should be configured to be highly available. This means that you must deploy multiple instances of the REST server, and those instances should be configured to share data. For example, data such as connection profiles, Blockchain identities, and REST API authentication settings should be shared so that a REST API client can make a request to any of the instances without having to reauthenticate.Configuring the REST server with a persistent data storeAll user information is persisted in a LoopBack data source by using a LoopBack connector. By default, the REST server uses the LoopBack &quot;memory&quot; connector to persist user information, which is lost when the REST server is terminated. The REST server should be configured with a LoopBack connector that stores data in a highly available data source, for example a database.You should be able to use any LoopBack connector, but we recommend that you use a LoopBack connector for a NoSQL database. For example, MongoDB or Apache CouchDB.The LoopBack connector needs to be installed in order for the REST server to locate and use it. You can install additional LoopBack connectors by using npm, for example:npm install -g loopback-connector-mongodbFinally, you need to supply the REST server with the connection information required by the LoopBack connector. This connection information should be supplied by using the COMPOSER_DATASOURCES environment variable. For more information, see below.Configuring the REST server using environment variablesThe REST server can be configured using environment variables, instead of supplying configuration options via the command line. The REST server supports the following environment variables:COMPOSER_CONFIGYou can use the COMPOSER_CONFIG environment variable to supply connection profiles to the REST server.For example:COMPOSER_CONFIG='{  \"connectionProfiles\": {    \"hlfv1\": {      \"name\": \"hlfv1\",      \"description\": \"Hyperledger Fabric v1.0\",      \"type\": \"hlfv1\",      \"keyValStore\": \"/home/composer/.composer-credentials\",      \"timeout\": 300,      \"orderers\": [        {          \"url\": \"grpc://orderer.example.com:7050\"        }      ],      \"channel\": \"composerchannel\",      \"mspID\": \"Org1MSP\",      \"ca\": {        \"url\": \"http://ca.org1.example.com:7054\",        \"name\": \"ca.org1.example.com\"      },      \"peers\": [        {          \"requestURL\": \"grpc://peer0.org1.example.com:7051\",          \"eventURL\": \"grpc://peer0.org1.example.com:7053\"        }      ]    }  }}'COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILEYou can use the COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE environment variable to specify the name of the connection profile that the REST server should use.For example:COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE=hlfv1COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORKYou can use the COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK environment variable to specify the name of the deployed business network that the REST server should connect to.For example:COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK=my-networkCOMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_IDYou can use the COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID environment variable to specify the enrollment ID of the Blockchain identity that the REST server should use to connect to the deployed business network.For example:COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID=loopback1COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRETYou can use the COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET environment variable to specify the enrollment secret of the Blockchain identity that the REST server should use to connect to the deployed business network.For example:COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=RVsigkBwXrDvCOMPOSER_NAMESPACESYou can use the COMPOSER_NAMESPACES environment variable to specify if the REST server should generate a REST API with namespaces or not. Valid values are always, required, and never.For example:COMPOSER_NAMESPACES=neverCOMPOSER_AUTHENTICATIONYou can use the COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION environment variable to specify if the REST server should enable REST API authentication or not. Valid values are true and false.For example:COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=trueFor more information, see Enabling authentication for the REST server.COMPOSER_MULTIUSERYou can use the COMPOSER_MULTIUSER environment variable to specify if the REST server should enable multiple user mode or not. Valid values are true and false.For example:COMPOSER_MULTIUSER=trueFor more information, see Enabling multiple user mode for the REST server.COMPOSER_DATASOURCESYou can use the COMPOSER_DATASOURCES environment variable to specify the LoopBack data sources and the connection information required by the selected LoopBack connector.For example:COMPOSER_DATASOURCES='{  \"db\": {    \"name\": \"db\",    \"connector\": \"mongodb\",    \"host\": \"mongo\"  }}'COMPOSER_PROVIDERSYou can use the COMPOSER_PROVIDERS environment variable to specify the Passport strategies that the REST server should use to authenticate clients of the REST API.For example:COMPOSER_PROVIDERS='{  \"github\": {    \"provider\": \"github\",    \"module\": \"passport-github\",    \"clientID\": \"REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_ID\",    \"clientSecret\": \"REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_SECRET\",    \"authPath\": \"/auth/github\",    \"callbackURL\": \"/auth/github/callback\",    \"successRedirect\": \"/\",    \"failureRedirect\": \"/\"  }}'COMPOSER_TLSYou can use the COMPOSER_TLS environment variable to specify if the REST server should enable HTTPS and TLS. Valid values are true and false.For example:COMPOSER_TLS=trueFor more information, see Securing the REST server using HTTPS and TLS.COMPOSER_TLS_CERTIFICATEYou can use the COMPOSER_TLS_CERTIFICATE environment variable to specify the certificate file that the REST server should use when HTTPS and TLS are enabled.For example:COMPOSER_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/tmp/cert.pemCOMPOSER_TLS_KEYYou can use the COMPOSER_TLS_KEY environment variable to specify the private key file that the REST server should use when HTTPS and TLS are enabled.For example:COMPOSER_TLS_KEY=/tmp/key.pemPackaging the REST server with additional Node.js modulesIn order to deploy the REST server as a Docker container with additional LoopBack connectors and Passport strategies, you must extend the hyperledger/composer-rest-server Docker image.Here is an example Dockerfile that adds the LoopBack connector for MongoDB and the Passport strategy for GitHub to the Docker image:FROM hyperledger/composer-rest-serverRUN npm install --production loopback-connector-mongodb passport-github &amp;&amp; \\    npm cache clean &amp;&amp; \\    ln -s node_modules .node_modulesYou can build this Docker image by placing the Dockerfile above into a directory and using the docker build command, for example:docker build -t myorg/my-composer-rest-server .You may need to publish this Docker image to a Docker image repository, for example Docker Hub, in order to use it with cloud based Docker deployment services.Deploying a persistent and secured REST server using DockerThe following example will demonstrate how to deploy the REST server using Docker. The deployed REST server will persist data using MongoDB, and will be secured using GitHub authentication.The examples are based on the business network that is deployed to Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 as part of the Developer Tutorial, and may need adjusting for your configuration, for example if the Docker network name does not match.Start an instance of MongoDB:docker run -d --name mongo --network composer_default -p 27017:27017 mongoCreate a new, empty directory. Create a new file named Dockerfile in the new directory, with the following contents:FROM hyperledger/composer-rest-serverRUN npm install --production loopback-connector-mongodb passport-github &amp;&amp; \\    npm cache clean &amp;&amp; \\    ln -s node_modules .node_modulesChange into the directory created in step 2, and build the Docker image:docker build -t myorg/my-composer-rest-server .Create a new file named envvars.txt, with the following contents:COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE=hlfv1COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK=my-networkCOMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID=adminCOMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=adminpwCOMPOSER_NAMESPACES=neverCOMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=trueCOMPOSER_MULTIUSER=trueCOMPOSER_CONFIG='{  \"connectionProfiles\": {    \"hlfv1\": {      \"name\": \"hlfv1\",      \"description\": \"Hyperledger Fabric v1.0\",      \"type\": \"hlfv1\",      \"keyValStore\": \"/home/composer/.composer-credentials\",      \"timeout\": 300,      \"orderers\": [        {          \"url\": \"grpc://orderer.example.com:7050\"        }      ],      \"channel\": \"composerchannel\",      \"mspID\": \"Org1MSP\",      \"ca\": {        \"url\": \"http://ca.org1.example.com:7054\",        \"name\": \"ca.org1.example.com\"      },      \"peers\": [        {          \"requestURL\": \"grpc://peer0.org1.example.com:7051\",          \"eventURL\": \"grpc://peer0.org1.example.com:7053\"        }      ]    }  }}'COMPOSER_DATASOURCES='{  \"db\": {    \"name\": \"db\",    \"connector\": \"mongodb\",    \"host\": \"mongo\"  }}'COMPOSER_PROVIDERS='{  \"github\": {      \"provider\": \"github\",      \"module\": \"passport-github\",      \"clientID\": \"REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_ID\",      \"clientSecret\": \"REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_SECRET\",      \"authPath\": \"/auth/github\",      \"callbackURL\": \"/auth/github/callback\",      \"successRedirect\": \"/\",      \"failureRedirect\": \"/\"  }}'Load the environment variables:source envvars.txtStart the Docker container:docker run \\    -d \\    -e COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE=${COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE} \\    -e COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK=${COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK} \\    -e COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID=${COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID} \\    -e COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=${COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET} \\    -e COMPOSER_NAMESPACES=${COMPOSER_NAMESPACES} \\    -e COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=${COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION} \\    -e COMPOSER_MULTIUSER=${COMPOSER_MULTIUSER} \\    -e COMPOSER_CONFIG=\"${COMPOSER_CONFIG}\" \\    -e COMPOSER_DATASOURCES=\"${COMPOSER_DATASOURCES}\" \\    -e COMPOSER_PROVIDERS=\"${COMPOSER_PROVIDERS}\" \\    --name rest \\    --network composer_default \\    -p 3000:3000 \\    myorg/my-composer-rest-serverYou should now be able to access the persistent and secured REST server using the following URL: http://localhost:3000/explorer/.Run the REST server in a Docker Container - with no security (eg. Dev/Test)These steps will run the REST server in a Docker Container with no security, and therefore no need for persistence of identities.  Activity on the REST server will be in the context of the Admin user used to start the REST server.  Running the REST server in this way is generally good for experimentation and learning, but is not likely to be appropriate for production use.Pull the Docker Image for the REST Server:docker pull hyperledger/composer-rest-serverCreate a new file named envvars.txt, with the following contents:(The values used below will typically work with a Test Fabric created from examples in this documentation, but the value of the COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK will need to be set correctly.)COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE=hlfv1COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK=&lt;my-network&gt;COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID=adminCOMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=adminpwCOMPOSER_NAMESPACES=neverCOMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=falseCOMPOSER_MULTIUSER=falseCOMPOSER_CONFIG='{  \"connectionProfiles\": {    \"hlfv1\": {      \"name\": \"hlfv1\",      \"description\": \"Hyperledger Fabric v1.0\",      \"type\": \"hlfv1\",      \"keyValStore\": \"/home/composer/.composer-credentials\",      \"timeout\": 300,      \"orderers\": [        {          \"url\": \"grpc://orderer.example.com:7050\"        }      ],      \"channel\": \"composerchannel\",      \"mspID\": \"Org1MSP\",      \"ca\": {        \"url\": \"http://ca.org1.example.com:7054\",        \"name\": \"ca.org1.example.com\"      },      \"peers\": [        {          \"requestURL\": \"grpc://peer0.org1.example.com:7051\",          \"eventURL\": \"grpc://peer0.org1.example.com:7053\"        }      ]    }  }}'Load the environment variables:source envvars.txtStart the Docker container:docker run \\    -d \\    -e COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE=${COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE} \\    -e COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK=${COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK} \\    -e COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID=${COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID} \\    -e COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=${COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET} \\    -e COMPOSER_NAMESPACES=${COMPOSER_NAMESPACES} \\    -e COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=${COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION} \\    -e COMPOSER_MULTIUSER=${COMPOSER_MULTIUSER} \\    -e COMPOSER_CONFIG=\"${COMPOSER_CONFIG}\" \\    -e COMPOSER_DATASOURCES=\"${COMPOSER_DATASOURCES}\" \\    -e COMPOSER_PROVIDERS=\"${COMPOSER_PROVIDERS}\" \\    --name resttest \\    --network composer_default \\    -p 3000:3000 \\    hyperledger/composer-rest-serverYou should now be able to access the persistent and secured REST server using the following URL: http://localhost:3000/explorer/.For the REST Server to work in this insecure mode, be sure that the environment variables COMPOSER_DATASOURCES and COMPOSER_PROVIDERS are not set to any value.  Also note the importance of the part of the docker run command --network composer_default which enables the REST Server to &#39;find&#39; the various Fabric Servers.",

        "category": "tutorials",
        "content": "Developer Tutorial for creating a Hyperledger Composer solutionNote: this tutorial was written against the latest Hyperledger Composer build on Ubuntu Linux running with Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 where referenced below and also tested for a Mac environment.This tutorial will walk you through the steps required to build a Hyperledger Composer blockchain solution from scratch. In the space of a few hours and probably less, you will be able to go from an idea for a disruptive blockchain innovation, to executing transactions against a real Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network, and in doing so, generating/running a sample Angular 2 based application (the tutorial is around a simple Commodity Trading use case) that interacts with a blockchain network. The idea is you can easily create your own use case, once you&#39;ve completed this end-to-end tutorial - furthermore, you can use the same blockchain environment to do so.Install Hyperledger ComposerFirst, make sure you have installed Hyperledger Composer. Follow this Development Environment Install guide where it also describes the pre-requisites required ; as well as installing Hyperledger Composer, it has instructions to quickly build your Hyperledger Fabric blockchain environment (using Docker containers) which we will use later on in this guide. It includes the installation of the Yeoman application generator and some pre-requisite Angular 2 packages.Install an Editor (eg. VSCode - and its Hyperledger Composer Extension for Syntax Highlighting)If you have not already installed this, install the VSCode editor an Open Source code editor for your dev environment. For Linux, download the package and install using the installation manager (eg. Ubuntu use dpkg  dpkg -i file.deb ).After installation, launch VSCode and select View &gt; Command Palette... then type extensions and select the Extensions: Install Extensions option. In the &quot;Search Extensions in Marketplace&quot; text field type Composer and install the Hyperledger Composer extension. You may have to &#39;Reload&#39; the extension (if prompted) to activate it.Create a Business Network DefinitionThe key concept for Composer is the business network definition (BND). It defines the data model, business (and therein transaction) logic and access control rules for your blockchain solution. It executes on Hyperledger Fabric. To create a BND,  we need to create a suitable project structure on disk.The easiest way to get started is to clone an existing sample business network. Open up a command prompt and clone the Composer sample networks GitHub repository. For Linux, perform this as a non-root user.git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks.gitThen, make a copy of this directory in your project, called &#39;my-network&#39;.cp -r ./composer-sample-networks/packages/basic-sample-network/  ./my-networkYou should now have a folder called my-network (as the basis for our project) that we can start to modify. Using VSCode,  open the my-network folder using Explorer in VSCode, click OK to open the folder. You should see the file layout in the explorer pane.Update your package.json fileThe metadata (name, version, description etc) for the business network definition is stored in the package.json file. Edit this file to change the name to my-network, the description to My Commodity Trading network and modify the prepublish script to change the name of the business network archive to my-network.bna at the end.\"name\": \"my-network\",  \"version\": \"0.1.6\",  \"description\": \"My Commodity Trading network\",  \"networkImage\": \"https://hyperledger.github.io/composer-sample-networks/packages/basic-sample-network/networkimage.svg\",  \"networkImageanimated\": \"https://hyperledger.github.io/composer-sample-networks/packages/basic-sample-network/networkimageanimated.svg\",  \"scripts\": {    \"prepublish\": \"mkdirp ./dist ; composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName . -a ./dist/my-network.bna\",    \"pretest\": \"npm run lint\",    \"lint\": \"eslint .\",    \"postlint\": \"npm run licchk\",    \"licchk\": \"license-check\",    \"postlicchk\": \"npm run doc\",    \"doc\": \"jsdoc --pedantic --recurse -c jsdoc.json\",    \"test-inner\": \"mocha -t 0 --recursive &amp;&amp; cucumber-js\",    \"test-cover\": \"nyc npm run test-inner\",    \"test\": \"npm run test-inner\"  },Save your changes to package.jsonUpdate your README.md fileOpen the README.md file and update the markdown with a short description of the business network.# My Commodity Trading networkSave your changes to README.mdDefine your Domain ModelOpen the file models/sample.cto and inspect the contents. This is the domain model for the business network definition. It defines the structure (schema) for the assets, transaction and participants in the business network. You can add as many model files as convenient under the models folder, however each model file must have a unique namespace; do note that you can import types from one namespace into other namespaces.As an example, we&#39;re going to replace the entire contents of the file &#39;sample.cto&#39; with a simplistic model (below) to track the ownership of commodities on the blockchain:/** * My commodity trading network */namespace org.acme.mynetworkasset Commodity identified by tradingSymbol {    o String tradingSymbol    o String description    o String mainExchange    o Double quantity    --&gt; Trader owner}participant Trader identified by tradeId {    o String tradeId    o String firstName    o String lastName}transaction Trade {    --&gt; Commodity commodity    --&gt; Trader newOwner}Save your changes to models/sample.ctoThe domain model defines a single asset (Commodity) and single participant (Trader) and a single transaction (Trade) that is used to modify the owner of a commodity.Write Transaction Processor FunctionsNow that the domain model has been defined, we can write the business logic for the business network definition. Composer expresses the logic for a business network using JavaScript functions. These functions are automatically executed when a transaction is submitted for processing.Open the file lib/sample.js in the left-hand pane and inspect the contents (note that you can create many JavaScript files as convenient for your business network definition). If a JavaScript function has the @transaction annotation, it will be automatically invoked when a transaction of the type defined by the @param annotation is submitted.Now replace the entire contents of sample.js with the function below (including the license header info)/* * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. * You may obtain a copy of the License at * * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 * * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and * limitations under the License. *//** * Track the trade of a commodity from one trader to another * @param {org.acme.mynetwork.Trade} trade - the trade to be processed * @transaction */function tradeCommodity(trade) {    trade.commodity.owner = trade.newOwner;    return getAssetRegistry('org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity')        .then(function (assetRegistry) {            return assetRegistry.update(trade.commodity);        });}This function simply changes the owner property on a commodity based on the newOwner property on an incoming Trade transaction. It then persists the modified Commodity back into the asset registry, used to store Commodity instances.Save your changes to lib/sample.jsUpdate your Access Control RulesThe file permissions.acl defines the access control rules for the business network definition. Replace the entire contents of permissions.acl with the rule below./** * Access control rules for mynetwork */rule Default {    description: \"Allow all participants access to all resources\"    participant: \"ANY\"    operation: ALL    resource: \"org.acme.mynetwork.*\"    action: ALLOW}rule SystemACL {  description:  \"System ACL to permit all access\"  participant: \"ANY\"  operation: ALL  resource: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.**\"  action: ALLOW}Save your changes to permissions.aclGenerate the Business Network ArchiveTo check that the structure of the files is valid, you can now generate a Business Network Archive (BNA) file for your business network definition. The BNA file is the deployable unit -- a file that can be deployed to the Composer runtime for execution.Switch back to the terminal and type:cd my-networknpm installYou should see the following output similar to the following (versions/modules change below):  │ │ └─┬ strip-ansi@4.0.0  │ │   └── ansi-regex@3.0.0  │ ├── which-module@2.0.0  │ ├── y18n@3.2.1  │ └── yargs-parser@7.0.0  └─┬ yargs-parser@5.0.0    └── camelcase@3.0.0$Write Unit TestsAll code should have unit tests - even your business network logic!We are now going to add a simple unit test for the business network definition. The unit test will run against the embedded  runtime. The embedded runtime actually stores the state of &#39;the blockchain&#39; in-memory in a Node.js process. This embedded runtime is very useful for unit testing, as it allows you to focus on testing the business logic rather than configuring an entire Fabric. The latter is more suited to running a system test (which is also possible of course, but is out of scope for this guide).From your project working directory (my-network), open the file test/sample.js and inspect the contents.The test code below will replace the namespace, types and logic of the unit test pertaining to &#39;my-network&#39; as shown below. For convenience, you can copy the entire script contents below and replace the current sample.js file contents entirely:/* * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. * You may obtain a copy of the License at * * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 * * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and * limitations under the License. */'use strict';const AdminConnection = require('composer-admin').AdminConnection;const BrowserFS = require('browserfs/dist/node/index');const BusinessNetworkConnection = require('composer-client').BusinessNetworkConnection;const BusinessNetworkDefinition = require('composer-common').BusinessNetworkDefinition;const path = require('path');require('chai').should();const bfs_fs = BrowserFS.BFSRequire('fs');const NS = 'org.acme.mynetwork';describe('Commodity Trading', () =&gt;

the following output:Import into Playground and TestEnsure you are at the top level project folder (my-network). Generate the BNA file using the following command:mkdir distcomposer archive create -a dist/my-network.bna --sourceType dir --sourceName .Note: the command npm run prepublish achieves the same thing (ie a command defined in our package.json file), but we wanted to show you the command sequence at this point in the tutorial and for your own projects, in time.The output of the archive command will look similar to this:Creating Business Network ArchiveLooking for package.json of Business Network Definition in /home/user/my-networkFound:Description: My Commodity Trading networkName:my-networkIdentifier:my-network@0.0.1Written Business Network Definition Archive file to ./dist/my-network.bnaCommand completed successfully.Command succeededThe composer archive create command has created a file called my-network.bna in the dist folder.Next, in a browser, navigate to the online Bluemix Composer Playground http://composer-playground.mybluemix.net and import the newly-generated BNA file into the Playground using the &quot;Import/Replace&quot; button at the bottom left of the screen. Locate the dist/my-network.bna file under your &#39;my-network&#39; folder and upload it. This automatically deploys the new business network.You can browse the structure of the Trade Commodity business network by pressing the link on the left, check the contents of the model, script files and access control.Next, navigate to the &quot;Test&quot; tab at the top and create two &#39;Trader&#39; participants (TRADER1 and TRADER2) by clicking the Trader registry on the left and then the &quot;Create New Participant&quot; button.{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER1\",  \"firstName\": \"Jenny\",  \"lastName\": \"Jones\"}{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER2\",  \"firstName\": \"Amy\",  \"lastName\": \"Williams\"}The Participant registry with the two entries should look like this:Create a new instance of a Commodity (asset) by navigating to the Commodity registry on the left and then click the &quot;Create New Asset&quot; button. Create the commodity and assign the owner to be &#39;TRADER1&#39;.{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity\",  \"tradingSymbol\": \"ABC\",  \"description\": \"Test commodity\",  \"mainExchange\": \"Euronext\",  \"quantity\": 72.297,  \"owner\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER1\"}The Asset registry should look like this:Next, submit a Trade transaction by clicking the &quot;Submit Transaction&quot; button, bottom left, to move the commodity from TRADER1 to TRADER2.{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trade\",  \"commodity\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity#ABC\",  \"newOwner\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER2\"}After processing, you should now see the transaction in the transaction registry.As a result, the owner of the commodity ABC should now be owned TRADER2.Deploy to the running Hyperledger FabricSo far, we&#39;ve created our business network definition, written a unit test and interactively tested the solution in the Playground.Now it is time to deploy to a real blockchain! We are going to deploy the BNA (suffix .bna) file to Hyperledger Fabric v1.0; this blockchain environment was set up earlier in this guide.Switch to the terminal, change directory to the dist folder containing the my-network.bna file and type:cd distcomposer network deploy -a my-network.bna -p hlfv1 -i PeerAdmin -s randomString -A admin -SNote: The flag &#39;-p&#39; specifies the name of the connection profile to use to connect to the Hyperledger Fabric network. The flags &#39;-A admin&#39; and &#39;-S&#39; specifies that the &#39;admin&#39; identity should be configured as a business network administrator. You will use the &#39;admin&#39; identity in subsequent commands to administer your business network.After approximately 30 seconds or so, the business network should have been deployed to your local Hyperledger Fabric. You should see output as follows:user@ubuntu $ composer network deploy -a my-network.bna -p hlfv1 -i PeerAdmin -s randomString -A admin -SDeploying business network from archive: my-network.bnaBusiness network definition:    Identifier: my-network@0.1.3    Description: My Commodity Trading network✔ Deploying business network definition. This may take a minute...Command succeededYou can verify that the network has been deployed by typing:composer network ping -n my-network -p hlfv1 -i admin -s adminpwWhich should give the following output:user@ubuntu $ composer network ping -n my-network -p hlfv1 -i admin -s adminpwThe connection to the network was successfully tested: my-network    version: 0.12.0    participant: org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin#adminCommand succeededGenerate REST APITo integrate with the deployed business network (creating assets/participants and submitting transactions) we can either use the Composer Node SDK or we can generate a REST API.If you are creating a web application (or running in a non Node.js environment) the REST API provides a useful layer of language-neutral abstraction.To create the REST API we need to launch the composer-rest-server and tell it how to connect to our deployed business network. The composer-rest-server was installed when you installed the development environment.Note that the module composer-rest-server would have been installed when you installed the Development environment.Now launch the server by changing directory to the my-network folder and type:cd ..composer-rest-serverAnswer the questions posed at startup as shown in the diagram below. These allow the composer-rest-server to connect to Hyperledger Fabric and configure how the REST API is generated.Test REST APIIf the composer-rest-server started successfully you should see these two lines are output:Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorerOpen a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/explorerYou should see the LoopBack API Explorer, allowing you to inspect and test the generated REST API.First, use the POST method on Trader to create a new instance of a Trader - first select &#39;List Operations&#39; alongside the Trader to see the operations available.{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER1\",  \"firstName\": \"Jenny\",  \"lastName\": \"Jones\"}Enter the values and then press the &quot;Try it Out&quot; button to submit. You should see an HTTP 200 response indicating that the Trader was successfully created and stored on the blockchain.Use the GET operation/method on Trader (leave the filter parameter blank) and press the &quot;Try it Out&quot; button. You should see your Trader returned.Similarly you can create/read/update/delete Commodities by using the appropriate HTTP request methods. You can submit a Trade transaction using an HTTP POST method on the /Trade API endpoint.Generate your Skeleton Web ApplicationYou are now ready to create a skeleton Angular web application to interact with your business network.Shut the composer-rest-server process down by pressing CTRL-C in the terminal window.Run the Hyperledger Composer generator, selecting the options below to generate an Angular application and to also generate a new REST API when prompted:yo hyperledger-composerYou should see that the generator has created Angular components for the asset types:create src/app/Commodity/Commodity.component.tscreate src/app/Commodity/Commodity.service.tscreate src/app/Commodity/Commodity.component.spec.tscreate src/app/Commodity/Commodity.component.htmlcreate src/app/Commodity/Commodity.component.cssWait a couple of minutes for the install of the application dependencies to complete.Next, change directory to your new Angular application directory (eg. my-app) - this may be located in your home directory (eg. /home/joe):Then start the application using npm start eg.cd my-appnpm startYour application is running. You should see the composer-rest-server start, and then Angular webpacks the web application - it serves the content at URL: http://localhost:4200If you navigate to this URL and press the &quot;Assets&quot; drop down (at the top-right of the page) you can see any existing instances of Commodity stored on the Hyperledger Fabric in the table (we have not stored them on blockchain yet!). You can create new instances using the &quot;Add Asset&quot; button. Note that the Angular skeleton does not yet allow you to create Participants, so you would need to create a test Trader instance to act as the owner of the Commodity (being added here), using the Loopback Swagger UI ( (ie using Playground) before you can create a Commodity.Congratulations!Well done, you&#39;ve now completed this tutorial and we hope you now have a much better idea how the capabilities fit together. You can start hacking on the skeleton Angular application to create the next industry defining blockchain-based application!Related LinksBusiness Network DefinitionDeploying a business networkNetwork deploy command",

        "content": "Installing and developing with Hyperledger ComposerFollow the instructions below to get the required Hyperledger Composer development tools and stand up a Hyperledger Fabric.Before you beginTo run Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric, we recommend you have at least 4Gb of memory.The following are prerequisites for installing the required development tools:Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12Docker Engine: Version 17.03 or higherDocker-Compose: Version 1.8 or higherNode: 6.x (note versions 7 and higher are not supported)npm: v3.x or v5.xgit: 2.9.x or higherPython: 2.7.xA code editor of your choice, we recommend VSCode.Please do not install Hyperledger Composer as a superuser - or use &#39;sudo&#39; or the &#39;root&#39; user, if on Linux (doing will cause issues installation errors). Hyperledger Composer should be installed as non-privileged user.If you&#39;re running on Ubuntu, you can download the prerequisites using the following commands:curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/prereqs-ubuntu.shchmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.shNext run the script - as this briefly uses sudo during its execution, you will be prompted for your password../prereqs-ubuntu.shIf you&#39;re running Mac OS X, you can follow the installation guide for Mac OS X pre-requisites.Step 1: Installing Hyperledger Composer development toolsThe development tools you&#39;ll need can all be installed (as a non-privileged user eg non-root) with npm install -g.To install composer-cli run the following command:npm install -g composer-cliThe composer-cli contains all the command line operations for developing business networks.To install generator-hyperledger-composer run the following command:npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composerThe generator-hyperledger-composer is a Yeoman plugin that creates bespoke applications for your business network.To install composer-rest-server run the following command:npm install -g composer-rest-serverThe composer-rest-server uses the Hyperledger Composer LoopBack Connector to connect to a business network, extract the models and then present a page containing the REST APIs that have been generated for the model.To install Yeoman run the following command:npm install -g yoYeoman is a tool for generating applications. When combined with the generator-hyperledger-composer component, it can interpret business networks and generate applications based on them.Optional development toolsIf you use VSCode, install the Hyperledger Composer VSCode plugin from the VSCode marketplace.If you want to run the Playground locally, install the composer-playground using the following command.npm install -g composer-playgroundStep 2: Starting Hyperledger FabricIf you&#39;ve installed the Hyperledger Composer Playground locally you&#39;ll need to close the containers by using the following scripts.Please note: These commands will kill and remove all running containers, and should remove all previously created Hyperledger Fabric chaincode images.docker kill $(docker ps -q)docker rm $(docker ps -aq)docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q)In a directory of your choice (will assume ~/fabric-tools) get the zip file that contains the tools to install Hyperledger Fabric v1.0.mkdir ~/fabric-tools &amp;&amp; cd ~/fabric-toolscurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.zipunzip fabric-dev-servers.zipA tar.gz file is also availablemkdir ~/fabric-tools &amp;&amp; cd ~/fabric-toolscurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.tar.gztar xvzf fabric-dev-servers.tar.gzIf this is the first time, you&#39;ll need to download the fabric runtime first. If you have already downloaded it, then start the fabric environment, and create a Hyperledger Composer profile. After that you can then choose to stop the fabric, and start it again later. Alternatively to completely clean up you can teardown the Hyperledger Fabric and the Hyperledger Composer profile.All the scripts will be in the directory ~/fabric-tools  A typical sequence for Hyperledger Composer use would becd ~/fabric-tools./downloadFabric.sh./startFabric.sh./createComposerProfile.shThen at the end of your development sessioncd ~/fabric-tools./stopFabric.sh./teardownFabric.shPlease note: The development environment created will include a PeerAdmin identity including the cryptographic material necessary for deploying business networks. This identity has no enrollment secret. Any enrollment secret supplied when deploying a business network will be accepted.Script details.This diagram explains the order in which the scripts can be run.Downloading FabricIssue from the fabric-tools directory./downloadFabric.shStarting FabricIssue  from the fabric-tools directory./startFabric.shStop FabricIssue from the fabric-tools directory./stopFabric.shCreate Hyperledger Composer ProfileIssue from the fabric-tools directory./createComposerProfile.shNote: this creates a Hyperledger Composer profile specifically to connect to the development fabric you&#39;ve already started.Teardown FabricIssue from the fabric-tools directory./teardownFabric.shWhat next?Begin writing a business network definition.If you&#39;re looking for a tutorial on using the developer tools, see the developer guide to run through a sample with the developer tools.",

If none is found, then a set of defaults will be used.The config module does write out a warning, if there are no configuration files set. Eg. WARNING: No configurations found in configuration directory. This can be suppressed with an environment variable if you are happy with the defaults and don&#39;t wish to use config in your application. See more information here.Diagnosing ProblemsIf something should ever go wrong with an application, what should you do about getting diagnostics?Let&#39;s look at the digitalproperty-app sample, and use that to explain how to get diagnostics out of the framework.Please note: This is a framework - so your application will need to have it&#39;s own logging framework. Also, your application could also have configuration information to control Hyperledger Composer&#39;s own logging.There are two containers that are relevant to logging;the one the application is running in, andthe chain code container that executes the transaction functions.ApplicationInternally, Hyperledger Composer uses the Winston node.js logging package by default, with an initial level of log points and destinations set up.Default ConfigurationThe framework will log information at these levels.ErrorWarnInfoVerboseDebugThe &#39;Silly&#39; level doesn&#39;t get used.Locations of informationBy default, there are two locations for data:One is a text file that is the location ${CurrentWorkingDir}/logs/trace_&lt;processid&gt;.trcThe other is stdout. By default, stdout will only show any data logged with a level of &#39;error&#39; and the file will show any data logged with &#39;info&#39; or above (i.e. info, warn and error).Control of what is producedThe Config module is used to locate information to control how the logs are produced.For example{  \"gettingstarted\": {       \"participantId\" : \"WebAppAdmin\",       \"participantPwd\" :\"DJY27pEnl16d\",       \"businessNetworkIdentifier\" : \"digitalproperty-network\",       \"connectionProfile\" :\"defaultProfile\"    },    \"ComposerConfig\": {       \"debug\": {         \"logger\": \"default\",         \"config\": {           \"console\": {             \"enabledLevel\": \"info\",             \"alwaysLevel\": \"none\"           },           \"file\": {             \"filename\": \"./trace_PID.log\",             \"enabledLevel\": \"silly\",             \"alwaysLevel\": \"info\"           }         }       }      }}The first section is specific to the Getting Started application, the second ComposerConfig section is for the Hyperledger Composer.logger is used to refer the module that does actual logging. default is implying that this is the winston frameworkconfig is passed to the logger to control what it does.  So this section is specific to the logger in use.Enabling more informationThe standard way of enabling node.js applications for debug is to use the DEBUG environment variable. So thereforeDEBUG=composer:* node myApplication.jsWill enabled more tracing - this then will use the levels marked as enabledLevel in the configuration above.How to find out which chaincode container has the deployed network?Each Business Network is deployed to it&#39;s own Chaincode container.  In the case of errors say with a transaction function, it can be helpful to look at the logs from that container and see what has happened. docker logs &lt;containerid&gt; will show the logs but you need to know the container id.Firstly list the docker processes and look for the image name; this command will do this for you in one stepdocker ps | cut -b 1-13,21-93CONTAINER ID IMAGE                                                                    f71e2a630d6a dev-vp0-9d0a2be10fc5b815bbca1f81c9abcb7072e33fc760342c5789c5bf9703c429c7bb5db2ca4e6a hyperledger/fabric-peer                                                  3ec0e41c4898 hyperledger/fabric-membersrvc     The hex value after the dev-vp0 is the &#39;chaincodeid&#39;. If you look in the connection profiles directory you&#39;ll see a simple JSON file that has the anem of the network mapped to the chaincode id. In this example we have two neworks listed.cat ~/.composer-connection-profiles/defaultProfile/connection.json{    \"type\": \"hlf\",    \"membershipServicesURL\": \"grpc://localhost:7054\",    \"peerURL\": \"grpc://localhost:7051\",    \"eventHubURL\": \"grpc://localhost:7053\",    \"keyValStore\": \"/home/matthew/.composer-credentials\",    \"deployWaitTime\": \"300\",    \"invokeWaitTime\": \"100\",    \"networks\": {        \"digitalproperty-network\": \"e3ec656109284b63d5b7b1925454c9904e6c9c82b2053ed190d2f199e0fb0dad\",        \"carauction-network\": \"9d0a2be10fc5b815bbca1f81c9abcb7072e33fc760342c5789c5bf9703c429c7\"    }};By inspection, the ids match for the carauction-network therefore we know now which chaincode container is which.--&gt;",

        "author": "",
        "category": "start",
        "content": "Enabling multiple user mode for the REST serverBy default, the Hyperledger Composer REST server services all requests by using the Blockchain identity specified on the command line at startup. For example, when using the following command, all requests made to the REST server will be serviced by using the Blockchain identity alice1 to digitally sign all transactions:composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cretThis means that the business network cannot distinguish between different clients of the REST server. This may be acceptable in certain use cases, for example if the Blockchain identity only has read-only access and the REST server is secured using an API management gateway.The REST server can be configured to multiple user mode. Multiple user mode permits clients of the REST server to provide their own Blockchain identities for digitally signing transactions. This enables the business network to differentiate between different clients of the REST server.Multiple user mode requires that REST API authentication is enabled, and will automatically enable REST API authentication if it is not explicitly specified. You must select and configure a Passport strategy for authenticating users. REST API authentication is required so that clients can be identified.Once a client has authenticated to the REST API, that client can add Blockchain identities to a wallet. The wallet is private to that client, and is not accessible to other clients. When a client makes a request to the REST server, a Blockchain identity in the clients wallet is used to digitally sign all transactions made by that client.Please note that this feature requires that clients trust the REST server. This trust is required because this feature requires that the REST server stores the clients Blockchain identities, including the private keys. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that clients only use REST servers that are managed by a trusted party, such as an administrator within their organization.Starting the REST server with multiple user mode enabledYou must configure the environment variable COMPOSER_PROVIDERS before continuing. For instructions on how to perform this task, read the following topic before continuing: Enabling authentication for the REST serverYou can use the -m true argument to start the REST server with multiple user mode enabled. Once multiple user mode is enabled, clients will have to authenticate before they can make any requests to the business network.For example, here is the command for the business network that is deployed as part of the Developer Tutorial, however you may need to modify the command for your business network:composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i admin -s adminpw -m trueThe -m true argument automatically enables REST API authentication. You can alternatively supply both arguments, -a true -m true, if you wish to be explicit. Before continuing, you must authenticate to the REST API using the configured authentication mechanism.Now, navigate to the REST API explorer at http://localhost:3000/explorer/. If multiple user mode has been successfully enabled, any attempts to call one of the business network REST API operations using the REST API explorer should be rejected with an No enrollment ID or enrollment secret has been provided error message.If you see a HTTP 401 Authorization Required error message, you have not authenticated correctly to the REST API.Adding a Blockchain identity to the default walletFirst, you must issue a Blockchain identity to a participant in the business network. This example will assume that you have issued the Blockchain identity alice1 to the participant org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#alice@email.com, and the secret is suchs3cret.Follow these steps to add a Blockchain identity to the default wallet:Navigate to the REST API explorer at http://localhost:3000/explorer/.List all of the authenticated clients wallets by expanding the Wallet category and calling the GET /wallets operation.The response from the operation should be similiar to the following:[  {    \"description\": \"Default wallet\",    \"id\": 1  }]Each wallet has a unique ID that will be used in subsequent REST API calls for interacting with the wallet. Note down the value of the id property for the wallet with the description Default wallet, in this example 1.List the Blockchain identities in the default wallet by calling the GET /wallets/{id}/identities operation with the id parameter set to the unique wallet ID noted from step 2.The response from the operation should be:[]This means that there are no Blockchain identities in the default wallet.Add the Blockchain identity to the default wallet by calling the POST /wallets/{id}/identities operation with the id parameter set to the unique wallet ID noted from step 2, and the data parameter set to the following JSON payload (do not include the id property in the JSON payload):{  \"enrollmentID\": \"alice1\",  \"enrollmentSecret\": \"suchs3cret\"}The response from the operation should be similiar to the following:{  \"enrollmentID\": \"alice1\",  \"enrollmentSecret\": \"suchs3cret\",  \"id\": 2}The Blockchain identity for alice1 has now been added to the default wallet. Each Blockchain identity has a unique ID that will be used in subsequent REST API calls for interacting with the Blockchain identity. Note down the value of the id property for the Blockchain identity, in this example 2.Set the Blockchain identity as the default Blockchain identity for the default wallet by calling the POST /wallets/{id}/identities/{fk}/setDefault operation with the id parameter set to the unique wallet ID noted from step 2, and the fk parameter set to the unique Blockchain identity ID noted from step 4.The response from the operation should be:no contentThe Blockchain identity has now been set as the default Blockchain identity for the default wallet.Now, navigate to the REST API explorer at http://localhost:3000/explorer/. Attempt to call one of the business network REST API operations again using the REST API explorer. This time, the calls should succeed.You can test that the Blockchain identity is being used by calling the GET /system/ping operation. This operation returns the fully qualified identifier for the participant that the Blockchain identity was issued to:{  \"version\": \"0.8.0\",  \"participant\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#alice@email.com\"}Final notesWhen the REST server is started with multiple user mode enabled, all REST API requests made by clients use a Blockchain identity stored in the clients wallet. The Blockchain identity specified on the command line at startup is not used to service any requests; it is only used to initially connect to the business network and download the business network definition, which is required to generate the REST API. Therefore, the Blockchain identity specified on the command line only requires minimal permissions - the ability to connect, and the ability to download the business network definition - it does not need permission for any assets, participants, or transactions.All user information is persisted in a LoopBack data source by using a LoopBack connector. By default, the REST server uses the LoopBack &quot;memory&quot; connector to persist user information, which is lost when the REST server is terminated. The REST server should be configured with a LoopBack connector that stores data in a highly available data source, for example a database. For more information, see Deploying the REST server.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "start",
        "content": "Enabling authentication for the REST serverThe REST server can be configured to authenticate clients. When this option is enabled, clients must authenticate to the REST server before they are permitted to call the REST API.Selecting an authentication strategyThe REST server uses the open source Passport authentication middleware. Administrators of the REST server must select Passport strategies to authenticate clients. Multiple Passport strategies can be selected, allowing clients of the REST server to select a preferred authentication mechanism. Passport includes a wide range of strategies (300+ at the time of writing), including a mix of social media (Google, Facebook, Twitter) and enterprise (SAML, LDAP) strategies.The rest of this document will demonstrate how to use the passport-github strategy to authenticate users using their GitHub ID. Install the passport-github strategy by executing the following command:npm install -g passport-githubConfiguring the REST server to use an authentication strategyThe REST server must be configured with a list of Passport strategies to use before REST API authentication can be enabled. This configuration includes both the names of the strategies to use and the individual configuration for each strategy.In order to configure the passport-github strategy, we will need to register an OAuth application on GitHub and retrieve the client ID and client secret. Follow these steps to register an OAuth application on GitHub:Navigate to GitHub and log in with your user ID and password.Click on your profile picture on the top right, and click on Settings from the drop down menu.Click on OAuth applications under Developer settings on the left hand bar.Click on Register a new application.Specify the following settings:Application name: ComposerHomepage: http://localhost:3000/Application description: OAuth application for ComposerAuthorization callback URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callbackClick on Register application.Note down the values for Client ID and Client Secret.The configuration for the REST server should be specified using the environment variable COMPOSER_PROVIDERS. Set the configuration for the REST server by replacing the values of REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_ID and REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_SECRET with the values retrieved from step 7, and executing the following command:export COMPOSER_PROVIDERS='{  \"github\": {    \"provider\": \"github\",    \"module\": \"passport-github\",    \"clientID\": \"REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_ID\",    \"clientSecret\": \"REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_SECRET\",    \"authPath\": \"/auth/github\",    \"callbackURL\": \"/auth/github/callback\",    \"successRedirect\": \"/\",    \"failureRedirect\": \"/\"  }}'Starting the REST server with REST API authentication enabledOnce the environment variable COMPOSER_PROVIDERS has been set, you can use the -a true argument to start the REST server with authentication enabled. Once authentication is enabled, clients will have to authenticate before they can make any requests to the business network.For example, here is the command for the business network that is deployed as part of the Developer Tutorial, however you may need to modify the command for your business network:composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i admin -s adminpw -a trueNow, navigate to the REST API explorer at http://localhost:3000/explorer/. If authentication has been successfully enabled, any attempts to call one of the business network REST API operations using the REST API explorer should be rejected with an HTTP 401 Authorization Required message.Authenticating to the REST server using a web browserThis step is dependent on the configuration and behaviour of the Passport strategies being used by the REST server.Authenticate to the REST server by navigating to the value of the authPath property specified in the environment variable COMPOSER_PROVIDERS. In the example above, this is http://localhost:3000/auth/github.The REST server will redirect you to GitHub to perform the OAuth web server authentication flow. GitHub will ask you if you want to authorize the Composer application to access your account. Click the Authorize button.If successful, GitHub will redirect you back to the REST server.Now, navigate to the REST API explorer at http://localhost:3000/explorer/. Attempt to call one of the business network REST API operations again using the REST API explorer. This time, the calls should succeed.Authenticating to the REST server using an HTTP or REST clientWhen a user authenticates to the REST server, a unique access token is generated and assigned to the authenticated user. When the user authenticates using a web browser, the access token is stored in a cookie in the local storage of the users web browser. When the authenticated user makes a subsequent request, the access token is retrieved from the cookie, and the access token is validated instead of reauthenticating the user.The access token can be used to authenticate any HTTP or REST client that wishes to call the REST server. This is required when the HTTP or REST client cannot perform the authentication flow required by the configured Passport strategy. For example, all OAuth2 web authentication flows require the use of a web browser to navigate to the authentication providers website.In order to use the access token, the access token must first be retrieved using a web browser. When you authenticate to the REST server, the REST API explorer at http://localhost:3000/explorer/ will show the access token at the top of the page. By default the access token is hidden, but it can be displayed by clicking the Show button. The access token is a long alphanumeric string, for example: e9M3CLDEEj8SDq0Bx1tkYAZucOTWbgdiWQGLnOxCe7K9GhTruqlet1h5jsw10YjJOnce the access token has been retrieved, the access token can be passed into any HTTP or REST request to authenticate the HTTP or REST client. There are two options for passing the access token - using either a query string parameter, or an HTTP header. For both of the following examples, replace the string xxxxx with the value of the access token.Query string - add the access_token query string parameter to all HTTP or REST requests:curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/system/ping?access_token=xxxxxHTTP header - add the X-Access-Token header to all HTTP or REST requests:curl -v -H 'X-Access-Token: xxxxx' http://localhost:3000/api/system/ping=======",

        "content": "Glossary and definition of termsFrom WikipediaA blockchain— originally block chain — is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. The data in a block cannot be altered retrospectively. Blockchains are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance.Access Control File: Access Control Files (.acl) are optional files within a business network definition. They describe assets or groups of assets and define the participants who can perform operations which affect those assets.Asset: An asset can be anything of value. A house is an example of a physical asset, and a mortgage is an example of non-physical asset. Assets within Hyperledger Composer can be defined to encompass any physical or non-physical asset.Blockchain: A blockchain is a shared and replicated ledger that can record asset transfers and changes. An implemented blockchain platform is often referred to as a Blockchain Fabric.Business Network Archive: A business network archive (.bna) is a compressed business network definition which contains at least a business network model and transaction processor functions and may optionally contain an access control file. Business network archives can be deployed to a Hyperledger fabric.Business Network Definition: A business network definition is made up of the business network model, transaction processor functions and optionally an access control file. The business network definition describes all assets, participants, transactions, and operations for a given solution, and can be interacted with by using a command line interface or an API.Business Network Model: The business network model describes the assets, participants, and transactions in the business network. The model is in effect the static object structure of the overall business network.Connection Profile: Connection profiles are .json files used by Hyperledger Composer to connect to an instance of Hyperledger Fabric.Composer Playground: The Hyperledger Composer Playground is an open toolset allowing business networks to be rapidly modelled and tested. Sample business networks can be imported to learn more about Hyperledger Composer and business network archives can be exported for local editing or later use.Events: Events are defined in the business network definition in the same way as assets or participants. Once events have been defined, they can be included in the transaction processor functions to be emitted as part of a transaction. Applications can subscribe to emitted events through the composer-client API.Fabric: A fabric is a blockchain platform that user applications connect to in order to interact with a ledger. Examples of blockchain fabrics include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Open Blockchain and Hyperledger.Hyperledger: Hyperledger is a Linux Foundation project to produce an open blockchain platform that is ready for business. It provides an implementation of the shared ledger, smart contracts, privacy and consensus mechanisms.Hyperledger Composer Admin API is an administrative API to build administrative applications. This API can deploy and update business network definitions on the Hyperledger Composer fabric runtime.Hyperledger Composer Client API The Client API is used by applications to connect to a business network and submit transactions. These applications could be command line, web applications, or end-user applications. The Client API permits CRUD operations on the assets that have been defined in the model. It also permits the submission of the transactions to be executed to update assets.Identity: An identity is a distinct unique identifier associated with a participant. When joining a business network, an identity is issued to a participant which is used by the participant to interact with the business network. Identity documents normally expire after a given length of time, but can be issued or revoked maunally. Hyperledger Composer uses Hyperledger Fabric enrollment certificates as identity documents.Modelling language: The Hyperledger Composer modelling language is used in the business network definition to describe the assets, participants, and transactions in the business network. For a more in-depth explanation of the modelling language, see modelling language documentation.Participant: Participants represent the organizations or people who take part in the digital business network. Participants are defined in the business network model.Registry: Registries are a stores of assets held on the blockchain. The contents of the registry are validated using the blockchain consensus mechanism.Transaction: Transactions are submitted by a participant to affect the assets held in the asset registries on the Hyperledger blockchain. Transactions with a business network are defined in the business network model, and their operations are defined in the transaction processor function file.Transaction Processor Functions: Transaction processor functions act on assets and participants to either create, update or delete properties on assets and participants. Transactions processor functions are written in JavaScript and contained in a script file as part of a business network definition.",

        "content": "Hyperledger Composer HistorianThe Hyperledger Composer Historian is a specialised registry which records successful transactions, including the participants and identities that submitted them. The historian stores transactions as HistorianRecord assets, which are defined in the Hyperledger Composer system namespace.The historian registry is a Hyperledger Composer system-level entity. To refer to the historian registry as a resource for access control the historian must be referenced as: org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord.Please note: All participants must have the permission to create HistorianRecord assets. If a transaction is submitted by a participant who does not have the permission to create HistorianRecord assets, the transaction will fail.HistorianRecord assetsThe historian registry stores successful transactions as HistorianRecord assets. Whenever a transaction successfully completes, a HistorianRecord asset is created and added to the historian registry. Record assets are defined in the system namespace, and have the following definition:asset HistorianRecord identified by transactionId {  o String      transactionId  o String      transactionType  --&gt; Transaction transactionInvoked  --&gt; Participant participantInvoking  optional  --&gt; Identity    identityUsed         optional  o Event[]       eventsEmitted        optional  o DateTime      transactionTimestamp}transactionId The transactionId of the transaction that caused the historian record to be created.String transactionType The class of transaction that caused the historian record to be created.Transaction transactionInvoked A relationship to the transaction which caused the historian record to be created.Participant participantInvoking A relationship to the participant who submitted the transaction.Identity identityUsed A relationship to the identity used to submit the transaction.Event[] eventsEmitted An optional property containing any events which were emitted by the transaction.DateTime transactionTimestamp The timestamp of the transaction which caused the historian record to be created.All historian record assets have relationships to the transaction that created them, the invoking participant of that transaction, and the identity used when the transaction was submitted. Applications that wish to obtain these attributes must resolve this relationship.System transactionsSeveral operations that the Hyperledger Composer runtime makes are classed as transactions. These &#39;system transactions&#39; are defined in the Hyperledger Composer system model. The following will add historian records:Adding, removing and updating assetsAdding, removing and updating participantsIssuing, binding, activating and revoking identitiesUpdating the business network definitionSecuring historian dataAs a registry, access to the historian data can be controlled with access control rules. However, as a system-level entity the resource name for the historian registry is always org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord.The following access control rule allows members to only see historian data if it references transactions they submitted.rule historianAccess{  description: \"Only allow members to read historian records referencing transactions they submitted.\"  participant(p): \"org.example.member\"  operation: READ  resource(r): \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord\"  condition: (r.participantInvoking.getIdentifier() == p.getIdentifier())  action: ALLOW}Retrieving historian dataData from the historian registry can be retrieved using either an API call, or queries.Using the client and REST APIs with historianHistorian records can be returned using the system/historian and system/historian/{id} calls using the REST API.When using the REST API, a GET call of system/historian will return ALL historian data. This call should be used with care, the return is not limited and may result in large volumes of data being returned.A GET call of system/historian/{id} using the REST API will return the HistorianRecord asset specified.Querying the HistorianHistorian can be queried in the same manner as other registries. For example, a typical query to return all HistorianRecord assets would be as follows:    .then(() =&gt; {               return businessNetworkConnection.getHistorian();    }).then((historian) =&gt; {        return historian.getAll();    }).then((historianRecords) =&gt; {                console.log(prettyoutput(historianRecords));    })As this is a &#39;getAll&#39; call it will potentially return high volume of data.

        "content": "Hyperledger Composer HistorianWarning: This is the first part of the implementation of functionality to track the transactions and asset updates. There are additional use cases that are not a covered by this implementation. Details are being tracked in GitHub issue 55. There may be changes to the HistorianRecord (documented below) as a result.The Historian is a registry populated with HistorianRecords that contains information about historical transactions.  When a transaction is submitted, the HistorianRecord is updated, and over time, maintains a history of transactions within a business network, and the participants and identities involved in submitting those transactions. Historian records can be queried using Composer Queries to extract specific records or data. An example would be tracking the lifecycle of an asset such as a Land Title, from creation (with a Land Title ID) through update, through ownership changes carried out by different identities and/or participants. The transactions associated with this example can be queried in Historian, say, over a given time period.Historian RecordA HistorianRecord is an &#39;asset&#39; defined in the Hyperledger Composer system namespace. HistorianRecords are defined as follows.asset HistorianRecord identified by transactionId {  o String      transactionId  o String      transactionType  --&gt; Transaction transactionInvoked  --&gt; Participant participantInvoking  optional  --&gt; Identity    identityUsed         optional  o Event[]       eventsEmitted        optional  o DateTime      transactionTimestamp}String transactionId Using the transaction id as the uuidString transactionType Type of the transaction that was submittedTransaction transactionInvoked Relationship to transactionParticipant participantInvoking Participant who invoked this transactionIdentity identityUsed The identity that was used by the participantEvent[] eventsEmitted The events that where emitted by this transactionIdDateTime transactionTimestamp Use the transaction&#39;s timestampIt&#39;s important to note that the Transaction, Participant and Identity are relationships. Applications that wish to obtain these attributes must resolve this relationship.Tracking TransactionsThe historian registry is updated for each successful transaction, transactions which fail are not recorded. In addition, several operations that the Hyperledger Composer runtime makes are classed as transactions. These &#39;system transactions&#39; are defined in the Hyperledger Composer system model. The following will add historian records.Add, Remove and Update of AssetsAdd, Remove and Update of ParticipantsIssue, Bind, Activate and Revoke of IdentitiesNote that the retrieval of assets and participants is not tracked.Querying the HistorianThe established APIs for querying and working with resources and relationship are applicable. The historian is a registry containing assets (HistorianRecords) so can be queried.For example to get all the Historian records a typical promise chain would be as follows.    .then(() =&gt; {               return businessNetworkConnection.getHistorian();    }).then((historian) =&gt; {        return historian.getAll();    }).then((historianRecords) =&gt; {                console.log(prettyoutput(historianRecords));    })As this is a &#39;getAll&#39; call it will potentially return high volume of data. Therefore the query capability is vital in being able to select a subset of records. A typical example would be to select records based on a time. This uses the query capability to select records where the transaction timestamp is past a certain point. The returned records can be processed in exactly the same way.  let now = new Date();  now.setMinutes(10);  // set the date to be time you want to query from  let q1 = businessNetworkConnection.buildQuery('SELECT org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord ' +                                                'WHERE (transactionTimestamp &gt; _$justnow)');     return businessNetworkConnection.query(q1,{justnow:now});More advanced queries can be used; for example, the following query selects and returns the Add, Update, and Remove asset system transactions.  // build the special query for historian records  let q1 = businessNetworkConnection.buildQuery(      `SELECT org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord          WHERE (transactionType == 'AddAsset' OR transactionType == 'UpdateAsset' OR transactionType == 'RemoveAsset')`  );        return businessNetworkConnection.query(q1);What next?Applying queries to a business network.Emitting events from transactions.Hyperledger Composer API documentation.",

It is only possible to access a blockchain Business Network through a valid Business Network Card. A Business Network Card contains and Identity for a single Participant within a deployed business network. Business Network Cards are used in the Hyperledger Composer Playground to connect to deployed Business Networks. You can have multiple Business Network Cards for a single deployed Business Network, where those Business Network Cards belong to multiple Participants.Business Network Cards are grouped under a Connection Profile, and each card shows the business network that may be accessed using the displayed Identity via the Connect now option. A Business Network Card may be deleted or exported using the icons present on the card.Here is a Business Network Card that may be used to connect to the business network named &#39;my-business-network&#39; using the Identity &#39;New User&#39;A Business Network Card can be created when an Identity is issued within the Playground. This Business Network Card can then be exported and shared with others, allowing them to connect to the business network using the issued identity. If a user is provided with a Enrollment ID and Secret by an administrator, which corresponds to a valid Identity within a business network, then a Business Network Card may be directly created in the Playground. It is also possible to manually create a Business Network Card.Providing Access To Your Business Network With a Business Network CardAccess to your Business Network is granted to another user through the provision of a Business Network Card. Once created, the Business Network Card may be exported and provided to the user for whom the card was created.There must be a Participant existing in the business network in order to bind an Identity required to create the Business Network Card.When an identity is issued within Playground, there is an option to save the identity for use in your Business Networks page. By selecting this option a Business Network Card is created for the issued identity that is valid for the current business network. The Business Network Card will appear on your Business Networks page once you log out of the current business network, and it is from this location where it may be exported to share with another user.Creating a Business Network CardFrom the Business Networks page, select an identity to use to connect to your business network. Click Connect Now. Please note: You must use an identity that has permission to create new identities.If required, create the participant to which you intend to assign the identity:Click the Test tab, and click Create New Participant.Complete the Participant defintion and click Create New.

Adding the Business Network Card to your Business Networks page allows you to use it to connect to the business network, or export it for someone else to use.The Business Networks page should now show the new Business Network Card.Exporting a Business Network CardBusiness Network Cards are exported from the Business Networks page in Playground, through interaction with the Business Network Card that you wish to export and is a one-step process.On the Business Networks page, click the Export icon on the Business Network Card you wish to export. The Business Network Card should download as a .card file.Please note: If you export a Business Network Card that has never been used, for example to send to a new participant, it will contain the enrollment ID and enrollment secret required to obtain the certificate and private key which are then used to identify Participants. Alternatively, if you export a Business Network Card that has been used before, it will already contain the certificate and private key. For more information on Participants and Identities, please see our main documentation.Important: Exported identity cards should be handled with care since they contain unprotected credentials. We recommend that you only send identity cards that have been encrypted.Creating Business Network Card CredentialsIt is possible to provide credentials to a user to enable them to create a Business Network Card and then use it to connect to the business network for which the credentials are valid.1.

For more informationon finding the unique identifiers for identities, look at Listing all identities in a business network.The procedure below shows an example using the following model of a participantfrom the Digital Property sample Business Network Definition: digitalproperty-networknamespace net.biz.digitalPropertyNetworkparticipant Person identified by personId {  o String personId  o String firstName  o String lastName}The example assumes that an instance, net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork#mae@biznet.org,of that participant has been created and placed into a participant registry.The example also assumes that an identity maeid1 has been issued to that participant,and the unique identifier for that identity is &#39;f1c5b9fe136d7f2d31b927e0dcb745499aa039b201f83fe34e243f36e1984862&#39;.ProcedureConnect to the business network and revoke an existing identity from a participantJavaScript APIconst BusinessNetworkConnection = require('composer-client').BusinessNetworkConnection;let businessNetworkConnection = new BusinessNetworkConnection();return businessNetworkConnection.connect('hlfv1', 'digitalproperty-network', 'admin', 'adminpw')    .then(() =&gt; {        return businessNetworkConnection.revokeIdentity('f1c5b9fe136d7f2d31b927e0dcb745499aa039b201f83fe34e243f36e1984862')    })    .then(() =&gt; {        return businessNetworkConnection.disconnect();    })    .catch((error) =&gt; {        console.error(error);        process.exit(1);    });Command linecomposer identity revoke -p hlfv1 -n 'digitalproperty-network' -i admin -s adminpw -u f1c5b9fe136d7f2d31b927e0dcb745499aa039b201f83fe34e243f36e1984862",

Integrating existing systems allows you to pull data from existing business systems and convert it to assets or participants in a Composer business network.Generating a REST APIHyperledger Composer includes a standalone Node.js process that exposes a business network as a REST API. The LoopBack framework is used to generate an Open API, described by a Swagger document.Publishing events from the REST serverThe REST server can be configured to subscribe to business events that are emitted from a deployed business network, and publish those business events out to client applications.Enabling authentication for the REST serverThe REST server can be configured to authenticate clients. When this option is enabled, clients must authenticate to the REST server before they are permitted to call the REST API.Enabling multiple user mode for the REST serverThe REST server can be configured to multiple user mode. Multiple user mode permits clients of the REST server to provide their own Blockchain identities for digitally signing transactions. This enables the business network to differentiate between different clients of the REST server.Securing the REST server using HTTPS and TLSWhen deploying Hyperledger Composer REST server in a production environment, the REST server should be configured to be secured with HTTPS and TLS (Transport Layer Security). Once the REST server has been configured with HTTPS and TLS, all data transferred between the REST server and all of the REST clients is encrypted.Deploying the REST server for a business networkBy deploying a REST server for a business network, you can integrate existing systems and data with your Hyperledger Composer business network, allowing you to create, update, or delete assets and participants, as well as get and submit transactions.Integrating with Node-REDNode-RED includes a number of Hyperledger Composer nodes allowing you to submit transactions, read, update and delete assets and participants, and subscribe to events.Calling external REST servicesTransaction processor functions can be used to call external REST services. This allows you to move complex computation off the blockchain.For instructions on setting up a Loopback API, see Generating a REST API.",

        "content": "Welcome to Hyperledger ComposerHyperledger Composer is an extensive, open development toolset and framework to make developing blockchain applications easier. Our primary goal is to accelerate time to value, and make it easier to integrate your blockchain applications with the existing business systems. You can use Composer to rapidly develop use cases and deploy a blockchain solution in weeks rather than months. Composer allows you to model your business network and integrate existing systems and data with your blockchain applications.Hyperledger Composer supports the existing Hyperledger Fabric blockchain infrastructure and runtime, which supports pluggable blockchain consensus protocols to ensure that transactions are validated according to policy by the designated business network participants.Everyday applications can consume the data from business networks, providing end users with simple and controlled access points.You can use Hyperledger Composer to quickly model your current business network, containing your existing assets and the transactions related to them; assets are tangible or intangible goods, services, or property. As part of your business network model, you define the transactions which can interact with assets. Business networks also include the participants who interact with them, each of which can be associated with a unique identity, across multiple business networks.How does Hyperledger Composer work in practice?For an example of a business network in action; a realtor can quickly model their business network as such:Assets: houses and listingsParticipants: buyers and homeownersTransactions: buying or selling houses, and creating and closing listingsParticipants can have their access to transactions restricted based on their role as either a buyer, seller, or realtor. The realtor can then create an application to present buyers and sellers with a simple user interface for viewing open listings and making offers. This business network could also be integrated with existing inventory system, adding new houses as assets and removing sold properties. Relevant other parties can be registered as participants, for example a land registry might interact with a buyer to transfer ownership of the land.Where do I go from here?To try Hyperledger Composer right away, see the Online PlaygroundFor an introduction to Composer components and concepts, see Key ConceptsFor an architectural overview of a typical solution built with Composer, see Typical Solution Architecture",

        "title": "Transaction Processor Functions",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Transaction Processor FunctionsA Hyperledger Composer Business Network Definition is composed of a set of model files and a set of scripts. The scripts may contain transaction processor functions that implement the transactions defined in the Business Network Definition&#39;s model files.Transaction processor functions are automatically invoked by the runtime when transactions are submitted using the BusinessNetworkConnection API.Decorators within documentation comments are used to annotate the functions with metadata required for runtime processing.Each transaction type has an associated registry storing the transactions.Transaction processor structureThe structure of transaction processor functions includes decorators and metadata followed by a JavaScript function, both parts are required for a transaction processor function to work.The first line of comments above a transaction processor function contains a human readable description of what the transaction processor function does. The second line must include the @param tag to indicate the parameter definition. The @param tag is followed by the resource name of the transaction which triggers the transaction processor function, this takes the format of the namespace of the business network, followed by the transaction name. After the resource name, is the parameter name which will reference the resource, this parameter must be supplied to the JavaScript function as an argument. The third line must contain the @transaction tag, this tag identifies the code as a transaction processor function and is required./*** A transaction processor function description* @param {org.example.sampleTransaction} parameter-name A human description of the parameter* @transaction*/After the comments is the JavaScript function which powers the transaction. The function can have any name, but must include the parameter name defined in the comment as an argument.function transactionProcessor(parameter-name) {  //Do some things.}A complete transaction processor function as detailed above would take the following format:/*** A transaction processor function description* @param {org.example.sampleTransaction} parameter-name A human description of the parameter* @transaction*/function transactionProcessor(parameter-name) {  //Do some things.}Writing a transaction processor functionA transaction processor function is the logical operation of a transaction defined in a model file. For example, a transaction processor function of a Trade transaction, might use JavaScript to change the owner property of an asset from one participant to another.Here&#39;s an example from the basic-sample-network, the following SampleAsset definition includes a property called value, which is defined as a string. The SampleTransaction transaction requires a relationship to an asset, the asset to be changed, the new value of the value property must be supplied as part of the transaction as a property called newValue.asset SampleAsset identified by assetId {  o String assetId  --&gt; SampleParticipant owner  o String value}transaction SampleTransaction {  --&gt; SampleAsset asset  o String newValue}The transaction processor function relating to the SampleTransaction transaction is what makes the change both to the asset and to the registry where the asset is stored.The transaction processor function defines the SampleTransaction type as the associated transaction, and defines it as the parameter tx. It then saves the original value of the asset to be changed by the transaction, replaces it with the value passed in during the submission of the transaction (the newValue property in the transaction definition), updates the asset in the registry, and then emits an event./** * Sample transaction processor function. * @param {org.acme.sample.SampleTransaction} tx The sample transaction instance. * @transaction */function sampleTransaction(tx) {    // Save the old value of the asset.    var oldValue = tx.asset.value;    // Update the asset with the new value.    tx.asset.value = tx.newValue;    // Get the asset registry for the asset.    return getAssetRegistry('org.acme.sample.SampleAsset')        .then(function (assetRegistry) {            // Update the asset in the asset registry.            return assetRegistry.update(tx.asset);        })        .then(function () {            // Emit an event for the modified asset.            var event = getFactory().newEvent('org.acme.sample', 'SampleEvent');            event.asset = tx.asset;            event.oldValue = oldValue;            event.newValue = tx.newValue;            emit(event);        });}Error handling in transaction processor functionsTransaction processor functions will fail and roll back any changes already made an error is thrown. The whole transaction fails, not just the transaction processing, and anything changed by the transaction processor function before the error occurred will be rolled back./** * Sample transaction processor function. * @param {org.acme.sample.SampleTransaction} tx The sample transaction instance. * @transaction */function sampleTransaction(tx) {    // Do something.    throw new Error('example error');    // Execution stops at this point; the transaction fails and rolls back.    // Any updates made by the transaction processor function are discarded.    // Transaction processor functions are atomic; all changes are committed,    // or no changes are committed.}Changes made by transactions are atomic, either the transaction is successful and all changes are applied, or the transaction fails and no changes are applied.Resolving relationships in transactionsWhen assets, transactions, or participants involved in a transaction have a property which includes a relationship, the relationships are resolved automatically. All relationships, including nested relationships, are resolved before the transaction processor functions runs.The following example includes nested relationships, the transaction has a relationship with an asset, which has a relationship with a participant, because all relationships are resolved, the owner property of the asset is resolved to the specific participant.Model file:namespace org.acme.sampleparticipant SampleParticipant identified by participantId {  o String participantId}asset SampleAsset identified by assetId {  o String assetId  --&gt; SampleParticipant owner}transaction SampleTransaction {  --&gt; SampleAsset asset}Script file:/** * Sample transaction processor function. * @param {org.acme.sample.SampleTransaction} tx The sample transaction instance. * @transaction */function sampleTransaction(tx) {    // The relationships in the transaction are automatically resolved.    // This means that the asset can be accessed in the transaction instance.    var asset = tx.asset;    // The relationships are fully or recursively resolved, so you can also    // access nested relationships. This means that you can also access the    // owner of the asset.    var owner = tx.asset.owner;}In this example, not only can the specific asset referenced by the relationship in the transaction be referenced using tx.asset, the specific participant referenced by the owner relationship can be referenced using tx.asset.owner. In this case, tx.asset.owner would resolve to reference a specific participant.Promise returns in transaction processor functionsSimilarly to relationships, transaction processor functions will wait for promises to be resolved before committing the transaction. If a promise is rejected, the transaction will fail.In the example code below there are several promises, the transaction will not be completed until each promise has returned.Model file:namespace org.acme.sampletransaction SampleTransaction {}Script file:/** * Sample transaction processor function. * @param {org.acme.sample.SampleTransaction} tx The sample transaction instance. * @transaction */function sampleTransaction(tx) {    // Transaction processor functions can return promises; Composer will wait    // for the promise to be resolved before committing the transaction.    // Do something that returns a promise.    return Promise.resolve()        .then(function () {            // Do something else that returns a promise.            return Promise.resolve();        })        .then(function () {            // Do something else that returns a promise.            // This transaction is complete only when this            // promise is resolved.            return Promise.resolve();        });}Using APIs in transaction processor functionsThe Hyperledger Composer APIs can be called within transaction processor functions, in the code example below, the getAssetRegistry call returns a promise which is resolved before the transaction is complete.Model file:namespace org.acme.sampleasset SampleAsset identified by assetId {  o String assetId  o String value}transaction SampleTransaction {  --&gt; SampleAsset asset  o String newValue}Script file:/** * Sample transaction processor function. * @param {org.acme.sample.SampleTransaction} tx The sample transaction instance. * @transaction */function sampleTransaction(tx) {    // Update the value in the asset.    var asset = tx.asset;    asset.value = tx.newValue;    // Get the asset registry that stores the assets. Note that    // getAssetRegistry() returns a promise, so we have to return    // the promise so that Composer waits for it to be resolved.    return getAssetRegistry('org.acme.sample.SampleAsset')        .then(function (assetRegistry) {            // Update the asset in the asset registry. Again, note            // that update() returns a promise, so so we have to return            // the promise so that Composer waits for it to be resolved.            return assetRegistry.update(asset);        })}What next?Transaction processor functions can also be used to:Define queries for retrieving information about the blockchain world-state from a couchDB database.Define events for sending event data to applications.",

        "content": "Key Concepts in Hyperledger ComposerHyperledger Composer is a programming model containing a modeling language, and a set of APIs to quickly define and deploy business networks and applications that allow participants to send transactions that exchange assets.Hyperledger Composer ComponentsYou can experience Hyperledger Composer with our browser-based UI called Hyperledger Composer Playground.  Playground is available as a hosted version (no install necessary) or a local install (good for editing and testing sample business networks offline).Developers who want to use Hyperledger Composer&#39;s full application development capabilities should install the Developer Tools.Key Concepts in Hyperledger ComposerBlockchain State StorageAll transactions submitted through a business network are stored on the blockchain ledger, and the current state of assets and participants are stored in the blockchain state database. The blockchain distributes the ledger and the state database across a set of peers and ensures that updates to the ledger and state database are consistent across all peers using a consensus algorithm.Connection ProfilesHyperledger Composer uses Connection Profiles to connect to a runtime. A Connection Profile is a JSON document that lives in the user&#39;s home directory (or may come from an environment variable) and is referenced by name when using the Composer APIs or the Command Line tools. Using connection profiles ensures that code and scripts are easily portable from one runtime instance to another. You can read more about Connection Profiles in the reference section.AssetsAssets are tangible or intangible goods, services, or property, and are stored in registries. Assets can represent almost anything in a business network, for example, a house for sale, the sale listing, the land registry certificate for that house, and the insurance documents for that house may all be assets in one or more business networks.Assets must have a unique identifier, but other than that, they can contain whatever properties you define. Assets may be related to other assets or participants.ParticipantsParticipants are members of a business network. They may own assets and submit transactions. Participant types are modeled, and like assets, must have an identifier and can have any other properties as required.Identities and ID cardsWithin a business network, participants can be associated with an identity. ID cards are a combination of an identity, a connection profile, and metadata. ID cards simplify the process of connecting to a business network, and extend the concept of an identity outside the business network to a &#39;wallet&#39; of identities, each associated with a specific business network and connection profile.TransactionsTransactions are the mechanism by which participants interact with assets. This could be as simple as a participant placing a bid on a asset in an auction, or an auctioneer marking an auction closed, automatically transferring ownership of the asset to the highest bidder.QueriesQueries are used to return data about the blockchain world-state. Queries are defined within a business network, and can include variable parameters for simple customization. By using queries, data can be easily extracted from your blockchain network. Queries are sent by using the Hyperledger Composer API.EventsEvents are defined in the business network definition in the same way as assets or participants. Once events have been defined, they can be emitted by transaction processor functions to indicate to external systems that something of importance has happened to the ledger. Applications can subscribe to emitted events through the composer-client API.Access ControlBusiness networks may contain a set of access control rules. Access control rules allow fine-grained control over what participants have access to what assets in the business network and under what conditions. The access control language is rich enough to capture sophisticated conditions declaratively, such as &quot;only the owner of a vehicle can transfer ownership of the vehicle&quot;. Externalizing access control from transaction processor function logic makes it easier to inspect, debug, develop and maintain.Historian registryThe historian is a specialised registry which records successful transactions, including the participants and identities that submitted them. The historian stores transactions as HistorianRecord assets, which are defined in the Hyperledger Composer system namespace.Where do I go from here?To try Hyperledger Composer right away, see the Online PlaygroundFor an architectural overview of a typical solution built with Composer, see Typical Solution ArchitectureTo install the Development Tools, see Getting setup with development tools",

A participant is a member of business networks and might represent individuals or organizations. Participants have identity documents which can be validated to prove their identity. For more information, see participants and identities.Adding participantsParticipants must be added to a business network before they can make transactions. Participants can create assets, and also exchange assets with other participants. A participant works with assets by submitting transactions.Creating, Exporting, and Importing ID CardsID cards combine a connection profile, identity, and certificates to allow a connection to a business network in Hyperledger Composer Playground. ID cards can be created, exported and imported from the My Wallet page in Hyperledger Composer Playground.Issuing a new identity to a participantA new identity can be issued to a participant using either the API or the command line. Once a new identity has been issued, the identity can then be used by the participant to interact with the business network in the context of that participant.Binding an existing identity to a participantAn existing identity can be bound to a participant using either the API or the command line.

        "content": "Model CompatibilityComposer models are expected to change and evolve over time. However some care and discipline must be applied when making model changes to ensure that existing instances are still valid with respect to the new model.A model M&#39; is compatible with model M if instances created with model M are valid with respect to model M&#39;. If the instances are valid, then they may be deserialized using the Serializer.The following terms are used throughout this document:Class : the declaration of the structure of an asset, participant, transaction, concept or eventInstance : an instance of a class, for example if org.example.Vehicle is an asset (class), then org.example.Vehicle#ABC123 is an instance of an org.acme.VehicleProperty : a member (or field) defined by a class, including a relationship. For example the class org.example.Vehicle may have a property called model of type string.A class (the asset SampleAsset):namespace org.acme.sampleasset SampleAsset identified by assetId {  o String assetId  --&gt; SampleParticipant owner  o String value}An instance of the class:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.sample.SampleAsset\",  \"assetId\": \"assetId:6463\",  \"owner\": \"resource:org.acme.sample.SampleParticipant#participantId:8091\",  \"value\": \"secret plant frequently ruler\"}Evolution of NamespacesA new class may be added to a namespace without breaking compatibility with pre-existing instances.Evolution of ClassesThis section describes the effects of changes to the declaration of a class and its properties on pre-existing instances.RenamingRenaming a class will break compatibility with any pre-existing instances of the class, or relationships to the class.abstract ClassesIf a class that was not declared abstract is changed to be declared abstract, then attempts to create new instances of that class will throw an error at runtime; such a change is therefore not recommended for widely distributed classes.Changing a class that is declared abstract to no longer be declared abstract does not break compatibility with pre-existing instances.SuperclassesAn error is thrown at load time if a class would be a superclass of itself. Changes to the class hierarchy that could result in such a circularity when instances are loaded are not recommended for widely distributed classes.Changing the direct superclass of a class type will not break compatibility with pre-existing instances, provided that the total set of superclasses of the class type loses no properties.If a change to the direct superclass results in any class no longer being a superclass respectively, then errors may result if pre-existing instances have relationships to the modified class. Such changes are not recommended for widely distributed classes.Class PropertiesNo incompatibility with pre-existing instances is caused by adding a property to a class if the property is either declared as optional or is assigned a default value. Adding new properties that are neither optional nor have a default will break compatibility with any pre-existing instances of the class.Changing the cardinality of a property (changing an array [] to a non-array or vice-a-versa) will break compatibility with any pre-existing instances of the class.Deleting a property from a class will break compatibility with any pre-existing instances that reference this field.Changing the type of a property may cause an error if the property is used by a pre-existing instance.Changing the validation expression of a property may cause an error if the property is used by a pre-existing instance.Properties that are relationships follow the same rules as for other types.Evolution of EnumsAdding or reordering constants in an enum type will not break compatibility with pre-existing instances.If a pre-existing instance attempts to access an enum constant that no longer exists, an error will occur. Therefore such a change is not recommended for widely distributed enums.In all other respects, the model evolutions rules for enums are identical to those for classes.",

If applications need to be able to deploy or administer business networks, then the composer-admin npm module can be used.The sample landregistry.js file contains a class to the represent the land regsitry and contains methods for listing the land titles, adding default titles, and submitting the transaction. This has been implemented using a JavaScript class; however you are free to structure your code as you wish.It&#39;s worth highlighting that the style of the API is to use promises. Typically Hyperledger Composer APIs will return a promise that is resolved when the operation has been successfully completed or with the result of the operation if applicable.If you&#39;re not familiar with Promise based development it&#39;s worth reviewing some of the tutorials online to get an idea.Modules requiredconst BusinessNetworkConnection = require('composer-client').BusinessNetworkConnection;For a Hyperledger Composer client application this is the only npm module required.Connecting to the Hyperledger Composer RuntimeA BusinessNetworkConnection instance is created and then used to connect to a runtime:this.bizNetworkConnection = new BusinessNetworkConnection();this.CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME = config.get('connectionProfile');this.businessNetworkIdentifier = config.get('businessNetworkIdentifier');The first Hyperledger Composer API call that we are going to make here, is the connect() API, to establish the connection to the Hyperledger Composer runtime on the Hyperledger Fabric.This API returns a Promise to the businessNetworkDefinition if successful:this.bizNetworkConnection.connect(this.CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME, this.businessNetworkIdentifier, participantId, participantPwd).then((result) =&gt; {  this.businessNetworkDefinition = result;});For a client application this is all the essential setup that is required, from this point on it&#39;s up to what the application wants to do as to what APIs are called.Adding assets to a registryThe Hyperledger Composer runtime will create a default registry for each type of modeled asset. So in this example, a LandTitle registry will have been created. What we want to do here is get access to that registry and then add some assets. The getAssetRegistry() method takes the fully qualified asset name as defined in the CTO model file (that is the namespace plus the name of the asset type). It returns a promise that is resolved with the asset registry:this.bizNetworkConnection.getAssetRegistry('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.LandTitle').then((result) =&gt; {    this.titlesRegistry = result;});Next step is to create some assets (look for the method _bootstrapTitles in the code )A factory style pattern is used to create assets. A factory is obtained from the businessNetworkDefinition and used to create instances of all the types defined in the business network.  Note the use of the namespace and asset name.  Then we can set the properties of this asset. The identifiers here (firstName lastName) matches with the properties defined in the model.let factory = this.businessNetworkDefinition.getFactory();owner = factory.newResource('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork', 'Person', 'PID:1234567890');owner.firstName = 'Fred';owner.lastName = 'Bloggs';We now have a Person! Now we need a land title. Note how the owner is specified as being the person we just created. (In the actual sample code we do this code twice to create landTitle1 and landTitle2).let landTitle2 = factory.newResource('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork', 'LandTitle', 'LID:6789');landTitle2.owner = owner;landTitle2.information = 'A small flat in the city';We now have a land title created that needs to be stored in the registry.this.titlesRegistry.addAll([landTitle1, landTitle2]);This is using an API to add multiple titles, which returns a promise that is resolved when the assets are added. The last thing we need to do is add the Person, Fred Bloggs. As this is a &#39;participant&#39;, the getParticipantRegistry API is used.this.bizNetworkConnection.getParticipantRegistry('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.Person')  .then((personRegistry) =&gt; {      return personRegistry.add(owner);  })Listing assets in a regsitryIn the sample application this is handled in a different method list().  The same setup as for putting assets is required, so as before we need to get the asset registry but this tile we call the getAll() API. This returns an array of objects.this.bizNetworkConnection.getAssetRegistry('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.LandTitle').then((registry) =&gt; {   return registry.getAll();}).then((aResources) =&gt; {  // instantiate  let table = new Table({    head: ['TitleID', 'OwnerID', 'First Name', 'Surname', 'Description', 'ForSale']  });  let arrayLength = aResources.length;  for(let i = 0; i &lt; arrayLength; i++) {    let tableLine = [];    tableLine.push(aResources[i].titleId);    tableLine.push(aResources[i].owner.personId);    tableLine.push(aResources[i].owner.firstName);    tableLine.push(aResources[i].owner.lastName);    tableLine.push(aResources[i].information);    tableLine.push(aResources[i].forSale ? 'Yes' : 'No');    table.push(tableLine);  }  // Put to stdout - as this is really a command line app  return(table);})Most of this isn&#39;t Hyperledger Composer API code - but it shows how to access the details of the objects that have been returned. At this point it&#39;s worth just looking again at the model.asset LandTitle identified by titleId {  o String   titleId  o Person   owner  o String   information  o Boolean  forSale   optional}participant Person identified by personId {  o String personId  o String firstName  o String lastName}You can see how the owner and title information are being accessed in a very simple manner.Submitting a transactionsThe last thing that we need to do is submit a transaction. This is the definition of the transaction in the model file:transaction RegisterPropertyForSale identified by transactionId{  o String transactionId  --&gt; LandTitle title}The transaction has two fields here, a trandsactionId, and a reference to the land title that should be submitted for sale. The first step is get access to the registry for the landtitle, and get back the specific land title we want to submit for sale.this.bizNetworkConnection.getAssetRegistry('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.LandTitle').then((registry) =&gt; {  return registry.get('LID:1148');})The getAssetRegistry call should now be looking a bit familiar, the get API is used to get a specific land title.The next step is to create the transaction we want to submit.let serializer = this.businessNetworkDefinition.getSerializer();let resource = serializer.fromJSON({  '$class': 'net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.RegisterPropertyForSale',  'title': 'LID:1148'});return this.bizNetworkConnection.submitTransaction(resource);What we need to do here is create a &#39;serializer&#39;.  This is able to create a resource - this resource is then passed to the submitTransaction API. Note that the transaction JSON matches the structure specified in the model file.ReferencesJavaScript API DocumentationPromises tutorial",

        "content": "Participants and identitiesConceptsA Participant is an actor in a business network. A participant might be an individual an organization. A participant can create assets, and also exchange assets with other participants. A participant works with assets by submitting transactions.A participant has a set of Identity documents that can be validated to prove the identity of that participant. For example, an individual may have one or more of the following identity documents that prove who they are:PassportDriving licenseFingerprintsRetina scanSSL certificateIn Hyperledger Composer, participants are separated from the set of identity documents that they can use to interact with a business network.In order for a new participant to join a business network, a new instance of that participant must be created in the business network. The participant instance stores all of the required information about that participant, but it does not give that participant access to interact with the business network.In order to grant the participant access to interact with the business network, an identity document must then be Issued to that participant. The new participant can then use that identity document to interact with the business network.A participant may have an existing identity document that they use to interact with other business networks or other external systems. These identity documents can be reused and Bound to that participant. The new participant can then use their existing identity document to interact with the business network.Identity documents usually expire after a set period of time. Identity documents may also be lost or stolen. If the identity document expires, or if it needs to be replaced, then it must be Revoked so it can no longer be used to interact with the business network.However, revoking an identity document does not remove the information about that participant and any assets that they own. Revoking the identity document simply removes the participants ability to interact with the business network using that identity document. Access to the business network can be restored by issuing the participant with a new identity document.These participant and identity management actions are performed by an existing participant in the business network, for example a regulatory body, or a participant in the same organization who has been trusted to manage participants/identities inthat organization.Participants and identities in Hyperledger ComposerIn Hyperledger Composer, the structure of a participant is modeled in a model file. This structure may include various information about the participant, for example the participants name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, etc. New instances of that modeled participant can then be created and added to a participant registry.Hyperledger Composer requires the use Blockchain identities as the form of identity documents. For example, when deploying a business network to Hyperledger Fabric, enrollment certificates are used as the form of identity document. These enrollment certificates are used to cryptographically sign the transactions that are submitted to the deployed business network.A deployed business network maintains a set of mappings of identities to participants in the Identity Registry. When an identity is Issued or Bound to a participant, a new mapping is added to the identity registry. When that participant uses that identity to submit transactions to the deployed business network, the Composer runtime looks for a valid mapping for that identity in the identity registry. This lookup is done using the public key signature or fingerprint, essentially a hash of the certificate contents that is unique to that certificate and identity.Once a mapping is found in the identity registry, the participant for that identity is retrieved from that mapping. That participant becomes the Current Participant, the participant who submitted the transaction. All access control in Hyperledger Composer is based around the current participant. Access control rules that define which participants can perform which operations on which resources all operate on the current participant.When a participant uses an identity to submit a transaction to the deployed business network for the first time, that identity is Activated. This means that the entry in the identity registry is updated to record the fact that the identity was used for the first time. Additional information about the identity, such as the certificate, may also be recorded in the identity registry during activation if it was not available when the identity was issued or bound to the participant.If and when an identity is revoked, the entry in the identity registry for that identity is updated to change the status to Revoked. After an identity is revoked, if a participant tries to use that identity to submit a transaction to the deployed business network, that transaction will be rejected.Identities and ID cards in the Hyperledger Composer PlaygroundIn the Hyperledger Composer Playground, there is a wallet containing locally stored ID cards. An ID card is an access card to a business network, comprising identity data, a connection profile, and the correct certificates for business network access. ID cards can be exported to allow the assignment of identities to others.Performing identity management tasks in Hyperledger ComposerThe Hyperledger Composer Node.js client APIs, REST APIs, and command line interfaces can all be used to perform identity management operations. For example, the following identity management operations are available through all Hyperledger Composer interfaces:Adding a new participant to a participant registryIssuing a new identity to a participantBinding an existing identity to a participantRevoking an identity from a participantListing all identities in a deployed business networkFor more information, see the related tasks and reference material at the bottom of this document.Related ConceptsBusiness Network  Related TasksCreate a Business Network DefinitionAdding participantsIssuing an new identity to a participantBinding an existing identity to a participantListing all identities in a business networkRevoking an identity from a participant  Related Referencecomposer participant addcomposer identity issuecomposer identity bindcomposer identity revokecomposer identity list  ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "playground",
        "content": "Playground TutorialIn this step by step tutorial we&#39;ll walk through setting up a business network, defining our assets, participants and transactions, and testing our network by creating some participants and an asset, and submitting transactions to change the ownership of the asset from one to another.Step One: Open the Hyperledger Composer PlaygroundOpen Composer Playground. You should see the My Wallet screen. The My Wallet page shows you a summary of the business networks you can connect to, and the identities you can use to connect to them. Don&#39;t worry about this too much for the time being, as we&#39;re going to create our own network.Step Two: Creating a new business networkNext, we want to create a new business network from scratch. A business network has a couple of defining properties; a name, and an optional description. You can also choose to base a new business network on an existing template, or import your own template.Click Deploy a new business network under the Web Browser heading to get started.The new business network needs a name, let&#39;s call it tutorial-network.Optionally, you can enter a description for your business network.Next we must select a business network to base ours on, because we want to build the network from scratch, click empty-business-network.Now that our network is defined, click Deploy.Step Three: Connecting to the business networkNow that we&#39;ve created and deployed the business network, you should see a new business network card called admin for our business network tutorial-network in your wallet. The wallet can contain business network cards to connect to multiple deployed business networks.When connecting to an external blockchain, business network cards represent everything necessary to connect to a business network. They include connection details, authentication material, and metadata.To connect to our business network click Connect now under our business network card.Step Four: Adding a model fileAs you can see, we&#39;re in the Define tab right now, this tab is where you create and edit the files that make up a business network definition, before deploying them and testing them using the Test tab.As we selected an empty business network template, we need to define our business network files. The first step is to add a model file. Model files define the assets, participants, transactions, and events in our business network.For more information on our modeling language, check our documentation.Click the Add a file button.Click the Model file and click Add.Delete the lines of code in the model file and replace it with this:/** * My commodity trading network */namespace org.acme.mynetworkasset Commodity identified by tradingSymbol {    o String tradingSymbol    o String description    o String mainExchange    o Double quantity    --&gt; Trader owner}participant Trader identified by tradeId {    o String tradeId    o String firstName    o String lastName}transaction Trade {    --&gt; Commodity commodity    --&gt; Trader newOwner}This domain model defines a single asset type Commodity and single participant type Trader and a single transaction type Trade that is used to modify the owner of a commodity.Step Five: Adding a transaction processor script fileNow that the domain model has been defined, we can define the transaction logic for the business network. Composer expresses the logic for a business network using JavaScript functions. These functions are automatically executed when a transaction is submitted for processing.For more information on writing transaction processor functions, check our documentation.Click the Add a file button.Click the Script file and click Add.Delete the lines of code in the script file and replace it with the following code:/** * Track the trade of a commodity from one trader to another * @param {org.acme.mynetwork.Trade} trade - the trade to be processed * @transaction */function tradeCommodity(trade) {    trade.commodity.owner = trade.newOwner;    return getAssetRegistry('org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity')        .then(function (assetRegistry) {            return assetRegistry.update(trade.commodity);        });}This function simply changes the owner property on a commodity based on the newOwner property on an incoming Trade transaction. It then persists the modified Commodity back into the asset registry, used to store Commodity instances.Step Six: Access controlAccess control files define the access control rules for business networks. Our network is simple, so the default access control file doesn&#39;t need editing. The basic file gives the current participant networkAdmin full access to business network and system-level operations.While you can have multiple model or script files, you can only have one access control file in any business network.For more information on access control files, check our documentation.Step Seven: Deploying the updated business networkNow that we have model, script, and access control files, we need to deploy and test our business network.Click Update to deploy the changes to our business network.Step Eight: Testing the business network definitionNext, we need to test our business network by creating some participants (in this case Traders), creating an asset (a Commodity), and then using our Trade transaction to change the ownership of the Commodity.Click the Test tab to get started.Step Nine: Creating participantsThe first thing we should add to our business network is two participants.Ensure that you have the Trader tab selected on the left, and click Create New Participant in the upper right.What you can see is the data structure of a Trader participant. We want some easily recognizable data, so delete the code that&#39;s there and paste the following:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER1\",  \"firstName\": \"Jenny\",  \"lastName\": \"Jones\"}Click Create New to create the participant.You should be able to see the new Trader participant you&#39;ve created. We need another Trader to test our Trade transaction though, so create another Trader, but this time, use the following data:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER2\",  \"firstName\": \"Amy\",  \"lastName\": \"Williams\"}Make sure that both participants exist in the Trader view before moving on!Step Ten: Creating an assetNow that we have two Trader participants, we need something for them to trade. Creating an asset is very similar to creating a participant. The Commodity we&#39;re creating will have an owner property indicating that it belongs to the Trader with the tradeId of TRADER1.Click the Commodity tab under Assets and click Create New Asset.Delete the asset data and replace it with the following:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity\",  \"tradingSymbol\": \"ABC\",  \"description\": \"Test commodity\",  \"mainExchange\": \"Euronext\",  \"quantity\": 72.297,  \"owner\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER1\"}After creating this asset, you should be able to see it in the Commodity tab.Step Eleven: Transferring the commodity between the participantsNow that we have two Traders and a Commodity to trade between them, we can test our Trade transaction.Transactions are the basis of all change in a Hyperledger Composer business network, if you want to experiment with your own after this tutorial, try creating another business network from the My Wallet screen and using a more advanced business network template.To test the Trade transaction:Click the Submit Transaction button on the left.Ensure that the transaction type is Trade.Replace the transaction data with the following, or just change the details:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trade\",  \"commodity\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity#ABC\",  \"newOwner\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER2\"}Click Submit.Check that our asset has changed ownership from TRADER1 to TRADER2, by expanding the data section for the asset. You should see that the owner is listed as resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER2.To view the full transaction history of our business network, click All Transactions on the left. Here is a list of each transaction as they were submitted. You can see that certain actions we performed using the UI, like creating the Trader participants and the Commodity asset, are recorded as transactions, even though they&#39;re not defined as transactions in our business network model. These transactions are known as &#39;System Transactions&#39; and are common to all business networks, and defined in the Hyperledger Composer Runtime.Logging out of the business networkNow that transactions have successfully run, we should log out of the business network, ending up at the My Wallet screen where we started.In the upper-right of the screen is a button labelled admin. This lists your current identity, to log out, click admin to open the dropdown menu, and click Log Out.What next?You&#39;ve completed the initial Hyperledger Composer Playground tutorial, you might want to either begin building your own business network using our other samples or templates.You might want to try the Developer Tutorial, to get your local development environment setup, generate a REST API and a skeleton web application.Or you can run Hyperledger Composer Playground locally connected to a real instance of Hyperledger Fabric.",

        "content": "Using PlaygroundThe Hyperledger Composer Playground provides a user interface for the configuration, deployment and testing of a business network. Advanced Playground features permit users to manage the security of the business network, invite participants to business networks and connect to multiple blockchain business networks.If you are new to the Playground, we recommend that you follow the Playground Tutorial that will guide you through the process of creating, deploying and testing a new blockchain business network before you start interacting with Business Network Cards.Please note: If two or more users are using Hyperledger Composer Playground to connect to the same instance of Hyperledger Fabric, ensure that each user refreshes their browser after the business network definition is updated by another user. Refreshing the browser accepts the changes to the business network definition made by other users. If the the business network is changed without accepting the changes of other users the changes will be lost.Navigating PlaygroundThe Business Networks pageThe Business Networks  page is the default Playground landing page. Here you can see all the Business Network Cards you have available for use. Each Business Network Card provides all of the information needed to connect to a blockchain business network. It is only possible to access a blockchain business network by using a valid Business Network Card. Once connected to a deployed Business Network, you will be taken to the Define page.From this page you can:Connect to a business network. If you already have a deployed business network and a Business Network Card created for it, you can click Connect now to connect to the business network.Deploy a new business network. If this is your first time using Playground, or you wish to start a new network, deploying your own network is a great place to start. When creating a new business network, you can choose to base your business network definition on a sample network, or create your own network from scratch.Interact with Business Network Cards. Business Network Cards are used to connect to business networks which already exist, and are a combination of connection profile and identity. The card provides options to delete the identity/card, export the card, and to connect to the corresponding business network.Import Business Network Cards. Importing an existing .card file from your computer is the simplest way to add a Business Network Card to your Business Networks page.Connect using a user ID and user secret. If you have been provided with a user ID and user secret by your network administrator, click Connect using credentials to enter them and generate a Business Network Card.Run through the Playground tutorial. If you don&#39;t know where to start, the Playground tutorial runs through creating a business network from scratch, and performing some basic operations.Business network optionsOnce connected to a business network using a Business Network Card, there are a number of options available whether you&#39;re looking at the Define tab, or the Test tab.In the upper-left is the name of the connection profile you&#39;re using and the business network you&#39;re connected to. In the example above, the connection profile is called Web and the business network name is basic-sample-network.Links to the Define and Test tabs. In the Define tab, you can add, modify and delete the content of your business network, and in the Test tab you can create assets and participants that were defined in the Define tab, and test the functionality of your business network.On the upper-right is a dropdown menu displaying the identity which is being used to connect to the business network. The dropdown contains a link to the Identity Registry, and the ability to log out of the business network, returning to the Business Networks page.The Define tabThe Define tab is used to create, edit and update your business network.On the left of the Define tab, you can see a list of all the files in your current business network definition. To examine the contents of a file, click on it, and it will appear in the editor view. New files can be added to your business network with the Add a file button. Model files, script files, access control files, and query files can be added to your business network.Once you&#39;ve added and modified the files for your business network definition, you can deploy the changes to your network with the Update button. After clicking Update you can experiment with your changes in the Test tab. The Import/Replace button allows you to import a business network, either from your own computer, or import a business network from our samples. Conversely, the Export button downloads your current business network as a .bna file.Please note: If two or more users are using Hyperledger Composer Playground to connect to the same instance of Hyperledger Fabric, ensure that each user refreshes their browser after the business network definition is updated by another user. Refreshing the browser accepts the changes to the business network definition made by other users. If the the business network is changed without accepting the changes of other users the changes will be lost.The Test tabThe Test tab is used to test the deployed business network by using the asset types, participant types, and transactions which you defined in the Define tab.On the left of the Test tab, each participant type and asset type is listed. Clicking on a participant type, asset type, or All transactions will display a registry, showing all active instances of that type. For example, by clicking SampleParticipant, you can see a registry showing all SampleParticipants that have been created. If it&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve looked at the Test tab, your registries will be empty!From within each registry, you can create the corresponding asset, participant, or submit the corresponding transaction.In the All transactions registry, also known as the Historian, you can see a record of each transaction that has taken place in your business network, including some transactions which are caused by system events, such as creating participants or assets. In the transaction registry, you can submit transactions, and then check that their effects have occurred by checking the resources that were changed.Playground TasksBusiness Network CardsProvide Access To Your Business Network With a Business Network CardGain Access To A Business Network with a Business Network Card",

You must have createdsome instances of those participants, and issued those participants with identities.The procedure below shows an example using the following participant models:namespace net.biz.digitalPropertyNetworkparticipant Person identified by personId {  o String personId  o String firstName  o String lastName}participant PrivilegedPerson extends Person {}ProcedureIn your transaction processor function, verify the type of the current participantmeets the requirements by using the getCurrentParticipant function:   function onPrivilegedTransaction(privilegedTransaction) {       var currentParticipant = getCurrentParticipant();       if (currentParticipant.getFullyQualifiedType() !== 'net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.PrivilegedPerson') {           throw new Error('Transaction can only be submitted by a privileged person');       }       // Current participant must be a privileged person to get here.   }In your transaction processor function, verify the participant ID of the currentparticipant by using the getCurrentParticipant function:   function onPrivilegedTransaction(privilegedTransaction) {       var currentParticipant = getCurrentParticipant();       if (currentParticipant.getFullyQualifiedIdentifier() !== 'net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.Person#PERSON_1') {           throw new Error('Transaction can only be submitted by person 1');       }       // Current participant must be person 1 to get here.   }The participant ID of the current participant can be compared to a participant   that is linked to an asset (by a relationship) to verify that the current   participant has the authority to access or modify an asset:   function onPrivilegedTransaction(privilegedTransaction) {       // Get the owner of the asset in the transaction.       var assetOwner = privilegedTransaction.asset.owner;       var currentParticipant = getCurrentParticipant();       if (currentParticipant.getFullyQualifiedIdentifier() !== asset.owner.getFullyQualifiedIdentifier()) {           throw new Error('Transaction can only be submitted by the owner of the asset');       }       // Current participant must be the owner of the asset to get here.   }",

        "content": "Emitting EventsEvents can be emitted by Hyperledger Composer and subscribed to by external applications. Events are defined in the model file of a business network definition, and are emitted by transaction JavaScript in the transaction processor functions file.Before you beginBefore you begin adding events to your business network, you should have a good understanding of the modeling language for business networks, and what makes up a full business network definition.ProcedureEvents are defined in the model file (.cto) of your business network definition, in the same way as assets and participants. Events use the following format:event BasicEvent {}In order for the event to be published the transaction which creates the event must call three functions, the first is the getFactory function. The getFactory allows events to be created as part of a transaction. Next, an event must be created by using factory.newEvent(&#39;org.namespace&#39;, &#39;BasicEvent&#39;). This creates a BasicEvent defined in a specified namespace. Then the required properties on the event must be set. Lastly, the event must be emitted by using emit(BasicEvent). A simple transaction which calls this event would look like this:/** * @param {org.namespace.BasicEventTransaction} basicEventTransaction * @transaction */function basicEventTransaction(basicEventTransaction) {    var factory = getFactory();    var basicEvent = factory.newEvent('org.namespace', 'BasicEvent');    emit(basicEvent);}This transaction creates and emits an event of the BasicEvent type as defined in the business network&#39;s model file. For more information on the getFactory function, see the Composer API documentation.What next?Subscribing to eventsDeveloping applications",

        "content": "Publishing events from the REST serverThe REST server can be configured to subscribe to business events that are emitted from a deployed business network, and publish those business events out to client applications. Currently, the REST server supports publishing business events out to client applications over WebSockets. Client applications can use a WebSocket client to subscribe to the business events that are published by the REST server. There are WebSocket clients available for all major programming languages and application types - for example, client side web user interfaces, backend server processes, mobile applications, and integration tools.Enabling WebSocketsYou can enable WebSockets using the -w argument to the command line:composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cret -wAlternatively, you can enable WebSockets by using the COMPOSER_WEBSOCKETS environment variable:export COMPOSER_WEBSOCKETS=truecomposer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cretWhen you have successfully enabled WebSockets, you will be able to connect a WebSocket client to the base URL displayed in the output of the REST server:Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorerIn this example, the base URL to use is http://localhost:3000. You must convert this into a WebSocket URL by changing the protocol from http to ws. In this example, the WebSocket URL to use is ws://localhost:3000.Testing that WebSockets has been enabledYou can test that WebSockets has been enabled by using a WebSocket client to subscribe to events. The open source command line application wscat can be used for this purpose.To install wscat, you can use npm. You may need to run this command with sudo, or as root, if you do not have the correct permissions to globally install npm modules:npm install -g wscatYou can then use wscat to connect to and subscribe to business events published by the REST server. Any business events received will be printed to the console:$ wscat -c ws://localhost:3000connected (press CTRL+C to quit)&lt; {\"$class\":\"org.acme.sample.SampleEvent\",\"asset\":\"resource:org.acme.sample.SampleAsset#assetId:1\",\"oldValue\":\"\",\"newValue\":\"hello world\",\"eventId\":\"a80d220b-09db-4812-b04b-d5d03b663671#0\",\"timestamp\":\"2017-08-23T12:47:17.685Z\"}&gt;",

        "content": "Queries Tutorial using the Composer Query language and REST APIsIn this tutorial, we will build on the &#39;Commodity Trading&#39; developer tutorial, extending it to show the use of queries in Composer. This tutorial demonstrates the power of the native Composer query language, as a means to filter results returned using criteria - and furthermore, to perform certain actions or operations on result sets, such as updating or removing assets using a transaction function that uses queries. Once you&#39;ve done the tutorial, feel free to try out your own queries!Queries are defined in  a query file (suffix .qry) in the parent directory of the business network definition. They are used to select assets or participants that meet certain criteria or conditions you define in the WHERE clause of a query. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the simple, defined sample queries in queries.qry from the trade-network sample network to get going - they are described in the file itself. In the main &#39;Commodity Trading&#39; Developer-Tutorial, we cloned the Composer sample-networks git repository, and created a new network &#39;my-network&#39; from basic-sample-network in the samples directory - this tutorial uses that network to get going.It is recommended to do the Developer-Tutorial first, where the business network my-network has first been deployed and setup steps are performed. Alternatively, you can  if you wish, do this tutorial from &#39;scratch&#39; but observe these following 3 steps:Build a new &#39;my-network&#39; VSCode project (as shown in the Developer tutorial where its based on the basic-sample-network project)Edit your package.json, once again changing the &#39;name&#39; field to my-network, the &#39;description&#39; to &#39;My Commodity Trading network&#39; and modify the &#39;prepublish&#39; script (at the end) to change the filename of the business network archive (.bna) - ie to &#39;my-network.bna&#39;Finally, you must use the composer network deploy command later on here (i.e. not &#39;composer network update&#39;) to deploy the BNA file as a new network (ie that step is referred to later on in this tutorial).Re-open your Commodities Trading &#39;my-network&#39; projectIn your project folder (in VSCode) open the folder my-network which is still the basis for our sample Trade project.Using VSCode, open the my-network folder using Explorer in VSCode, click OK to open the folder. You should see the file layout in the explorer pane.Update your &#39;Commodities Trade&#39; Model FileReplace your sample.cto file contents, with the contents of the updated model shown below. This effectively enhances our Commodities Trade Network to add new transaction processor &#39;RemoveHighQuantityCommodities&#39; (that will use queries from queries.qry defined later) and events (used in our business transaction logic file lib/logic.js to notify of significant events)./** * Commodity trading network */namespace org.acme.mynetworkasset Commodity identified by tradingSymbol {    o String tradingSymbol    o String description    o String mainExchange    o Double quantity    --&gt; Trader owner}participant Trader identified by tradeId {    o String tradeId    o String firstName    o String lastName}transaction Trade {    --&gt; Commodity commodity    --&gt; Trader newOwner}event TradeNotification {    --&gt; Commodity commodity}transaction RemoveHighQuantityCommodities {}event RemoveNotification {    --&gt; Commodity commodity}Save your changes to models/sample.ctoUpdate Transaction logic to use Queries &amp; EventsNow that the domain model has been updated, we can write the additional business logic that gets executed when a transaction is submitted for processing. In this tutorial we have added events and queries to the business logic below.Open the file lib/sample.js in the left-hand pane and inspect the current logic.Now select all the contents and delete it - replacing it with the entire code sample shown below:/* * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. * You may obtain a copy of the License at * * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 * * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and * limitations under the License. *//** * Track the trade of a commodity from one trader to another * @param {org.acme.mynetwork.Trade} trade - the trade to be processed * @transaction */function tradeCommodity(trade) {    // set the new owner of the commodity    trade.commodity.owner = trade.newOwner;    return getAssetRegistry('org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity')        .then(function (assetRegistry) {            // emit a notification that a trade has occurred            var tradeNotification = getFactory().newEvent('org.acme.mynetwork', 'TradeNotification');            tradeNotification.commodity = trade.commodity;            emit(tradeNotification);            // persist the state of the commodity            return assetRegistry.update(trade.commodity);        });}/** * Remove all high volume commodities * @param {org.acme.mynetwork.RemoveHighQuantityCommodities} remove - the remove to be processed * @transaction */function removeHighQuantityCommodities(remove) {    return getAssetRegistry('org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity')        .then(function (assetRegistry) {            return query('selectCommoditiesWithHighQuantity')                    .then(function (results) {                        var promises = [];                        for (var n = 0; n &lt; results.length; n++) {                            var trade = results[n];                            // emit a notification that a trade was removed                            var removeNotification = getFactory().newEvent('org.acme.mynetwork', 'RemoveNotification');                            removeNotification.commodity = trade;                            emit(removeNotification);                            // remove the commodity                            promises.push(assetRegistry.remove(trade));                        }                        // we have to return all the promises                        return Promise.all(promises);                    });        });}The first function tradeCommodity will change the owner property on a commodity (with a new owner Participant) on an incoming Trade transaction and emit a Notification event to that effect. It then persists the modified Commodity back into the asset registry which is used to store Commodity instances.The second function calls a named query &#39;selectCommoditiesWithHighQuantity&#39; (defined in queries.qry) which will return all Commodity asset records that have a quantity &gt; 60 ; emit an event ; and remove the Commodity from the AssetRegistry.Save your changes to lib/sample.jsCreate your Query Definition File for your Business NetworkThe queries used by the Transaction Processor logic are defined in a file called queries.qry. Each query entry defines the resources and criteria against which the query is executed.In your project view, create a new file under my-network top level directory called queries.qry and paste the contents of these defined queries into the editor - there is a description provided for each query definition ; the parameters passed into the query (by the TP function) are distinguished by a leading _$ below to signify the parameter supplied to the query at runtime./** Sample queries for Commodity Trading business network*/query selectCommodities {  description: \"Select all commodities\"  statement:      SELECT org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity}query selectCommoditiesByExchange {  description: \"Select all commodities based on their main exchange\"  statement:      SELECT org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity          WHERE (mainExchange==_$exchange)}query selectCommoditiesByOwner {  description: \"Select all commodities based on their owner\"  statement:      SELECT org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity          WHERE (owner == _$owner)}query selectCommoditiesWithHighQuantity {  description: \"Select commodities based on quantity\"  statement:      SELECT org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity          WHERE (quantity &gt; 60)}Update your Access Control Rules (ACLs)The file permissions.acl defines the access control rules for the business network definition. Replace the entire contents of permissions.acl with the rules below./** * Access control rules for mynetwork */rule Default {    description: \"Allow all participants access to all resources\"    participant: \"ANY\"    operation: ALL    resource: \"org.acme.mynetwork.*\"    action: ALLOW}rule SystemACL {  description:  \"System ACL to permit all access\"  participant: \"ANY\"  operation: ALL  resource: \"org.hyperledger.composer.system.**\"  action: ALLOW}Save your changes to permissions.aclRe-generate your Business Network archive (BNA)Due to the changes in our business network,  we need to re-generate the Business Network Archive (BNA) file for your newly updated business network definition. This new network will later be updated to the Composer runtime, and become the latest deployed network. From the previous tutorial, we have already done an npm install of our business network.Switch back to the terminal, then from the my-network project directory,  type:composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName . -a ./dist/my-network.bnaThe output should be similar to the following:Creating Business Network ArchiveLooking for package.json of Business Network Definition in /home/user/my-networkFound:Description:My very first Hyperledger Composer NetworkName:my-networkIdentifier:my-network@0.0.1Written Business Network Definition Archive file to ./dist/my-network.bnaCommand completed successfully.Command succeededThe `composer archive create` command has updated the file called `my-network.bna` in the `dist` folder.Write and Perform Unit Tests, to include QueriesAll code should have unit tests - even your business network logic (why, of course!)We are now going to add a simple unit test for the business network definition, testing the logic of our queries as well as the rudimentary asset, participant and transaction tests. The unit test will run against the embedded runtime. The embedded runtime actually stores the state of &#39;the blockchain&#39; in-memory in a Node.js process.From your project working directory (my-network), open the file test/sample.js and inspect the contents.The test code below will replace the namespace, types and logic of the unit test pertaining to my-network as shown below. For convenience, you can copy the entire script contents below and replace the current sample.js file contents entirely:/* * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. * You may obtain a copy of the License at * * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 * * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and * limitations under the License. */'use strict';const AdminConnection = require('composer-admin').AdminConnection;const BrowserFS = require('browserfs/dist/node/index');const BusinessNetworkConnection = require('composer-client').BusinessNetworkConnection;const BusinessNetworkDefinition = require('composer-common').BusinessNetworkDefinition;const path = require('path');require('chai').should();const bfs_fs = BrowserFS.BFSRequire('fs');const NS = 'org.acme.mynetwork';describe('Commodity Trading', () =&gt;

defined in the file features/sample.feature will produce the following output (redacted):Next, in a browser, navigate to the online Bluemix Composer Playground http://composer-playground.mybluemix.net and import the newly-generated BNA file into the Playground using the &quot;Import/Replace&quot; button at the bottom left of the screen. Locate the dist/my-network.bna file under your my-network folder and upload it, then press the &quot;Deploy&quot; button. Confirm to replace the current network definition in Playground.You can browse the structure of the updated Trade Commodity business network by pressing the link on the left, check out the contents of the model, script files, query files and access control.Deploy the updated Business Network Definition to the runtime FabricWe need to deploy our modified network (my-network) to become the latest edition on the blockchain! We are using the newly created archive business network archive file (suffix .bna) file to update the existing business network on the runtime Hyperledger Fabric; this is the same business network name, that we used during the Developer Tutorial guide. (Remember: if you did not complete the Developer tutorial before this tutorial, use the command  composer network deploy and not composer network update )Switch to the terminal, change directory to the dist folder containing the my-network.bna file:cd distcomposer network update -a my-network.bna -p hlfv1 -i PeerAdmin -s randomStringYou should get output similar to below:Deploying business network from archive: my-network.bnaBusiness network definition:    Identifier: my-network@0.0.1    Description: My very first Hyperledger Composer Network✔ Updating business network definition. This may take a few seconds...Command succeededYou can test that it deployed OK:composer network ping -n my-network -p hlfv1 -i admin -s adminpwRegenerate the REST APIs for the updated Business NetworkWe will now integrate the newly updated business network with queries added, and expose the REST APIs for this sample business network.Launch the Composer REST server by changing directory to the &#39;my-network&#39; folder as shown below:cd ..composer-rest-serverAnswer the questions posed at startup as shown. These allow the composer-rest-server to connect to Hyperledger Fabric and configure how the REST API is generated.Test the Trading REST APIs and create some dataIf the composer-rest-server started successfully you should see these two lines are output:Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorerOpen a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/explorer . You should see the LoopBack API Explorer, allowing you to inspect and test the generated REST API.We should be able to see that the REST Endpoint called &#39;Query&#39; has been added and, upon expanding, reveals the list of REST Query operations defined in the business network my-networkBefore we proceed, we need to create some data, to demonstrate queries adequately. Using the sample JSON data provided, create 3 Traders (Participants)and some more Commodities (Assets) using the REST APIs.First, click on &#39;Trader&#39; in the REST Explorer, then click on the &#39;POST&#39; method on /Trader, then scroll down to the Parameter section - create the following Trader instances, in turn:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER1\",  \"firstName\": \"Jenny\",  \"lastName\": \"Jones\"}then click &#39;Try it out&#39; to create the Participant. The &#39;Response Code&#39; (scroll down) should be 200 (SUCCESS)Once again, copy the JSON data below -  click &#39;Try it out&#39; and check the code again is 200{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER2\",  \"firstName\": \"Jack\",  \"lastName\": \"Sock\"}Once again, copy the JSON data below -  click &#39;Try it out&#39; and check the code again is 200.{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Trader\",  \"tradeId\": \"TRADER3\",  \"firstName\": \"Rainer\",  \"lastName\": \"Valens\"}Now scroll up to the top and click on &#39;Commodity&#39; object in the REST Explorer. Click on the POST operation and scroll down to the Parameters section: In the same way as above, create two Commodity Asset records (see below) for owners TRADER1 and TRADER2:{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity\",  \"tradingSymbol\": \"EMA\",  \"description\": \"Corn\",  \"mainExchange\": \"EURONEXT\",  \"quantity\": 10,  \"owner\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER1\"}and{  \"$class\": \"org.acme.mynetwork.Commodity\",  \"tradingSymbol\": \"CC\",  \"description\": \"Cocoa\",  \"mainExchange\": \"ICE\",  \"quantity\": 80,  \"owner\": \"resource:org.acme.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER2\"}Perform Queries using the Commodity Trading REST API ExplorerNow that we have some Assets and Participants, we can test out some queries using the generated Query REST operations.Perform Simple REST QueryNow that we have &#39;data&#39;, we can try out some queries.The simplest REST query we can try out first is our named query &#39;selectCommodities&#39;.Expand the &#39;Queries&#39; (REST Endpoint) and you will see the named queries we defined in our model.These queries are now exposed as REST queries and for which a /GET operation is generated, Note that the description of the query (that we defined in our model definition) is shown on the right hand side.Expand &#39;selectCommodities&#39; and click the &#39;Try it Out&#39; button.It will return all existing Commodities - there should be at least 2 Commodities.Perform Filtered REST QueriesLet&#39;s select all Commodities by their main Exchange - for example &#39;EURONEXT&#39; main exchange.Expand query Endpoint &#39;selectCommoditiesByExchange&#39; and scroll to the &#39;Parameters&#39; section. Enter &#39;EURONEXT&#39; in the &#39;Exchange&#39; parameter, and click &#39;Try it Out&#39;.The results reveal that only those Commodities with an Exchange of &#39;EURONEXT&#39; are shown in the response bodyPerform Transaction update using results from named QueryFinally, you will recall we had defined a simple query that filters Commodities with a Quantity greater than 60 in our query file. Queries are very powerful, when used in transaction functions, as using queries allows transaction logic to set up the set of assets or participants to perform updates on, or for creating remove actions for example.We use the query &#39;removeHighQuantityCommodities&#39; in the Transaction Processor logic written in the lib/sample.js script file. If you execute this /GET operation in the REST Explorer, you&#39;ll see it selects only those assets greater than 60 in quantity.Now let&#39;s use the query to perform a removal of high quantity commodites.First check for yourself how many Commodities are present (use the &#39;Commodity&#39; /GET operation) and you should see at least two Commodities, one of which (Cocoa) has a quantity &gt; 60.Let&#39;s check out the actual query, by clicking on the REST Endpoint /selectCommoditiesWithHighQuantity and click /GET then scroll down to &#39;Try it Out&#39; - there should be one Commodity that meets the criteria.OK. Now let&#39;s execute a REST transaction, that uses our &#39;High Quantity&#39; query definition to decide which Commodities to remove.Click on the RemoveHighQuantityCommodities REST Endpoint to reveal the /POST operation for same.Click on POST, scroll down to the Parameter section and click &#39;Try it Out&#39; - note: you do not have to enter any data in the &#39;data&#39; section.Scroll down and you should see a transactionId which represents the &#39;remove&#39; invocation (itself a blockchain transaction) inside of the transaction processor function and which will update the world state - the Response Code should be 200Finally, let&#39;s verify our Commodities status. Return to the &#39;Commodity&#39; REST Operations and once again perform a /GET operation....&#39;Try it Out&#39;.The results should show that the Commodity asset &#39;Cocoa&#39; has now gone, ie only those Commodity assets with a quantity &lt;= 60 still remain, ie asset &#39;Corn&#39; in our example. The named query fed the transaction update (to remove high quantity Commodities) and which was executed in business logic.Congratulations!Well done, you&#39;ve now completed this tutorial and we hope you now have a much better idea of the power of queries in Composer. You can start creating/building your own queries (or modifying the existing queries and adding associated data to this business network - note: you would need to re-deploy any query changes) to try out!Related LinksDeveloper-TutorialDeploying a business networkNetwork deploy command",

        "content": "Hyperledger Composer Query LanguageQueries in Hyperledger Composer are written in a bespoke query language. Queries are defined in a single query file called (queries.qry) within a business network definition.Query SyntaxAll queries must contain the description and statement properties.DescriptionThe description property is a string which describes the function of the query. It must be included but can contain anything.StatementThe statement property contains the defining rules of the query, and can have the following operators:SELECT is a mandatory operator, and by default defines the registry and asset or participant type that is to be returned.FROM is an optional operator which defines a different registry to query.WHERE is an optional operator which defines the conditions to be applied to the registry data.AND is an optional operator which defines additional conditions.OR is an optional operator which defines alternative conditions.CONTAINS is an optional operator that defines conditions for array valuesORDER BY is an optional operator which defines the sorting or results.SKIP is an optional operator which defines the number of results to skip.LIMIT is an optional operator which defines the maximum number of results to return from a query, by default limit is set at 25.Example QueryThis query returns all drivers from the default registry whose age is less than the supplied parameter or whose firstName is &quot;Dan&quot;, as long as their lastName is not &quot;Selman&quot;.In practical terms, this query returns all drivers who do not have the lastName &quot;Selman&quot;, as long as they are under a defined age, or have the firstName Dan, and orders the results by lastName ascending and firstName descending.query Q20{    description: \"Select all drivers younger than the supplied age parameter or who are named Dan and whose lastName is not Selman, ordered by lastname, firstname\"    statement:        SELECT org.acme.Driver            WHERE ((age &lt; _$ageParam OR firstName == 'Dan') AND (lastName != 'Selman'))                ORDER BY [lastName ASC, firstName DESC]}Parameters in queriesQueries can be written with undefined parameters that must be supplied when running the query. For example, the following query returns all drivers where the age property is greater than the supplied parameter:query Q17 {    description: \"Select all drivers aged older than PARAM\"    statement:        SELECT org.acme.Driver            WHERE (_$ageParam &lt; age)}What next?Applying queries to a business network.Emitting events from transactions.Hyperledger Composer API documentation.",

        "content": "Querying and filtering business network dataQueries are used to return data about the blockchain world-state; for example, you could write a query to return all drivers over a specified age, or all drivers with a specific name. The composer-rest-server component exposes named queries via the generated REST API.Queries are an optional component of a business network definition, written in a single query file (queries.qry).Note: When using the Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 runtime Hyperledger Fabric must be configured to use CouchDB persistence.Filters are similar to queries, but use the LoopBack filter syntax, and can only be sent using the Hyperledger Composer REST API. Currently, only the WHERE LoopBack filter is supported. The supported operators within WHERE are: =, and, or, gt, gte, lt, lte, neq. Filters are submitted using a GET call against an asset type, participant type, or transaction type; the filter is then supplied as a parameter. Filters return the results from the specified class, and will not return results from classes extending the specified class.Types of QueriesHyperledger Composer supports two types of queries: named queries and dynamic queries. Named queries are specified in the business network definition and are exposed as GET methods by the composer-rest-server component. Dynamic queries may be constructed dynamically at runtime within a Transaction Processor function, or from client code.Writing Named QueriesQueries must contain a description and a statement. Query descriptions are a string that describe the function of the query. Query statements contain the operators and functions that control the query behavior.Query descriptions can be any descriptive string. A query statement must include the SELECT operator and can optionally include FROM, WHERE, AND, ORDER BY, SKIP, and LIMIT.Queries should take the following format:query Q1{  description: \"Select all drivers older than 65.\"  statement:      SELECT org.acme.Driver          WHERE (age&gt;65)}Query ParametersQueries may embed parameters using the _$ syntax. Note that query parameters must be primitive types (String, Integer, Double, Long, Boolean, DateTime), a Relationship or an Enumeration.The named query below is defined in terms of 3 parameters:query Q18 {    description: \"Select all drivers aged older than PARAM\"    statement:        SELECT org.acme.Driver            WHERE (_$ageParam &lt; age)                ORDER BY [lastName ASC, firstName DESC]                    LIMIT _$limitParam                        SKIP _$skipParam}Query parameters are automatically exposed via the GET method created for named queries by the composer-rest-server.For more information on the specifics of the Hyperledger Composer query language, see the query language reference documentation.Queries using the APIQueries can be invoked by calling the buildQuery or query APIs. The buildQuery API requires the entire query string to be specified as part of the API input. The query API requires you to specify the name of the query you wish to run.For more information on the query APIs, see the API documentation.Access Control for QueriesWhen returning the results of a query, your access control rules are applied to the results. Any content which the current user does not have authority to view is stripped from the results.For example, if the current user sends a query that would return all assets, if they only have authority to view a limited selection of assets, the query would return only that limited set of assets.Using filtersFilters can only be submitted using the Hyperledger Composer REST API, and must use the LoopBack syntax. To submit a query, a GET REST call must be submitted against an asset type, participant type, or transaction type with the filter supplied as a parameter. The supported data types for parameters to be filtered are numbers, Boolean, DateTime, and strings. A basic filter takes the following format, where op indicates an operator:{\"where\": {\"field1\": {\"op\":\"value1\"}}}Please note: Only the top level WHERE operator can have more than two operands.Currently, only the WHERE LoopBack filter is supported. The supported operators within WHERE are: =, and, or, gt, gte, lt, lte, neq. Filters can combine multiple operators, in the following example, an and operator is nested within an or operator.{\"where\":{\"or\":[{\"and\":[{\"field1\":\"foo\"},{\"field2\":\"bar\"}]},{\"field3\":\"foobar\"}]}}The between operator returns values between the given range. It accepts numbers, datetime values, and strings. If supplied with strings, the between operator returns results between the supplied strings alphabetically. In the example below, the filter will return all resources where the driver property is alphabetically between a and c, inclusively.{\"where\":{\"driver\":{\"between\": [\"a\",\"c\"]}}}",

Once the REST server has been configured with HTTPS and TLS, all data transferred between the REST server and all of the REST clients is encrypted.You must provide both a certificate and a private key pair to configure the REST server. The REST server includes a sample certificate and private key pair that can be used to easily get going, but this configuration is only recommended for ease of use during initial development. Do not use the sample certificate and private key pair in a production environment.## Enabling HTTPS and TLS by using the sample certificate and private key pairYou can enable HTTPS and TLS using the sample certificate and private key pair by using the `-t` argument to the command line:    composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cret -tAlternatively, you can enable HTTPS and TLS using the sample certificate and private key pair by using the `COMPOSER_TLS` environment variable:    export COMPOSER_TLS=true    composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cretWhen you have successfully enabled HTTPS and TLS, you will see that the output of the REST server specifies an `https://` URL instead of a `http://` URL:    Web server listening at: https://localhost:3000    Browse your REST API at https://localhost:3000/explorerThis configuration is only recommended for ease of use during initial development. For a test, QA, or production deployment, you should provide your own certificate and private key to enable HTTPS and TLS.## Enabling HTTPS and TLS by providing a certificate and private key pairYou can enable HTTPS and TLS by providing your own certificate and private key pair. The certificate and private key pair must be provided as two separate files in the PEM format. The files must be available on the file system of the system running the REST server, and the REST server must have read access to those files.You can configure the THE REST server to use your certificate and private key pair files by using the '-c' (certificate file) and '-k' (private key file) arguments to the command line:    composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cret -t -c /tmp/cert.pem -k /tmp/key.pemAlternatively, you can configure the THE REST server to use your certificate and private key pair files by using the `COMPOSER_TLS_CERTIFICATE` and `COMPOSER_TLS_KEY` environment variables:    export COMPOSER_TLS=true    export COMPOSER_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/tmp/cert.pem    export COMPOSER_TLS_KEY=/tmp/key.pem    composer-rest-server -p hlfv1 -n my-network -i alice1 -s suchs3cret",

I.e. business logic that runs on the blockchain, REST APIs that expose the blockchain logic to web or mobile applications, as well as integrating the blockchain with existing enterprise systems of record.---{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} is composed of the following high-level components:* Execution Runtimes (four are currently supported!)* JavaScript SDK* Command Line Interface* REST Server* LoopBack Connector* Playground Web User Interface* Yeoman code generator* VSCode and Atom editor plugins## Execution Runtimes{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} has been designed to support different pluggable runtimes, and currently has three runtime implementations:.* {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} version 1.0. State is stored on the distributed ledger.* Web, which executes within a web page, and is used by Playground. State is stored in browser local storage.* Embedded, which executes within a Node.js process, and is used primarily for unit testing business logic. State is stored in an in-memory key-value store.### Connection ProfilesConnection Profiles are used across {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} to specify how to connect to an execution runtime. There are different configuration options for each _type_ of execution runtime. For example, the connection profile for an {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} version 1.0 runtime will contain the TCP/IP addresses and ports for the Fabric peers, as well as cryptographic certificates etc.Connection Profiles are referred to by name (in both code and on the command line) and the connection profile documents (in JSON format) are resolved from the user's home directory.## JavaScript SDKThe {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} JavaScript SDK is a set of Node.js APIs the enables developers to create applications to manage and interact with deployed business networks.The APIs are split between two npm modules:1. `composer-client` used to submit transactions to a business network or to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on assets and participants2. `composer-admin` used to manage business networks (deploy, undeploy)Details of all the APIs are available as JSDocs (see reference).### composer-clientThis module would usually be installed as a local dependency of an application. It provides the API that is used by business applications to connect to a business network to access __assets__, __participants__ and submitting __transactions__. When in production this is only module that needs to be added as a direct dependency of the application.### composer-adminThis module would usually be installed as a local dependency of **administrative** applications. This API permits the creation of and deployment of __business network definitions__.## Command Line InterfaceThe `composer` command line tool enables developers and administrators to deploy and managed business network definitions.## REST ServerThe {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} REST Server automatically generates a Open API (Swagger) REST API for a business network. The REST Server (based on LoopBack technology) converts the {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} model for a business network into an Open API definition, and at runtime implements Create, Read, Update and Delete support for assets and participants and allows transactions to be submitted for processing or retrieved.## LoopBack ConnectorThe {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} LoopBack Connector is used by the {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} REST Server, however it may also be used standalone by integration tools that support LoopBack natively. Alternatively it may be used with the LoopBack tools to create more sophisticated customizations of the REST APIs.## Playground Web User Interface{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Playground is a web user interface to define and test business networks. It allows a business analyst to quickly import samples and prototype business logic that executes on the Web or {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} runtime.## Yeoman Code Generators{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} uses the Open Source Yeoman code generator framework to create skeleton projects:* Angular web application* Node.js application* Skeleton business network## VSCode and Atom Editor Extensions{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} has community contributed editor extensions for VSCode and Atom. The VSCode extension is very powerful and validates {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} model and ACL files, providing syntax highlighting, error detection and snippets support. The Atom plugin is much more rudimentary and only has basic syntax highlighting.",

        "content": "# Subscribing to eventsNode.js applications can subscribe to events from a business network by using the `composer-client.BusinessNetworkConnection.on` API call. Events are defined in the business network model file and are emitted by specified transactions in the transaction processor function file. For more information on publishing events, see [publishing events](../business-network/publishing-events.html).## Before you beginBefore an application can subscribe to events, you must have defined some events and the transactions which will emit them. The business network must also be deployed and you must have a connection profile that can connect to it.## Procedure1. An application must send a specific API call to subscribe to events emitted transactions in a business network. Currently, an application which subscribes to events will receive all events which are emitted. The API call should take the following format:```JavascriptbusinessNetworkConnection.on('event', (event) => {    // event: { \"$class\": \"org.namespace.BasicEvent\", \"eventId\": \"0000-0000-0000-000000#0\" }    console.log(event);});```  This includes an event called `BasicEvent` which was created in the [publishing events](../business-network/publishing-events.html) documentation. The `eventId` property is always the same as the `transactionId` of the transaction which emitted the event, with an appended number in the form `\"transactionId\": \"#number\"`.## What next?The application will now receive all of the events emitted by the business network, and it's up to the application to choose to what extent those events are integrated.---",

        "content": "# Testing Business Networks{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} supports three types of testing: interactive testing, automated unit testing and automated system testing. All three serve different purposes and are vital to ensuring the success of your blockchain projects.After you have deployed a business network definition it is often useful to run an interative \"smoke test\" to ensure that the deployment was successful. The `composer` CLI exposes several commands for running such smoke tests.At the other end of the spectrum you can write full-blown system tests using Docker Compose and Mocha/Chai, that start a runtime, deploy your business network definition and then programmatically creates assets, submits transactions and inspect the state of asset registries.In between fall unit tests. Unit tests focus on ensuring that the correct changes to the world-state take place when a transaction is processed.The execution of both unit tests and system tests may be automated using a CI/CD build pipeline, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or Circle CI or alternatives.## Interactive TestingYou can use the Playground to interactively test creating participants, assets and submitting transactions.## Testing from the Command LineThe command line can be used to inspect the state of the runtime and to submit transactions. Use the `composer network list` command to see the state of asset and participant registries. Use the `composer transaction submit` command to submit transactions.## Creating Unit TestsThe business logic in transaction processor functions should have unit tests, ideally with 100% code coverage. This will ensure that you do not have typos or logic errors in the business logic.You can use standard JavaScript testing libraries, such as Mocha, Chai, Sinon and Istanbul to unit test the logic in your transaction processor functions.The `embedded` runtime is very useful for unit testing, as it allows you to quickly test business logic in a simulated Node.js blockchain environment, without having to stand-up a {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.Please refer to the sample networks for examples of unit tests.

When used in this mode, all the functionality of {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Playground is available, but all of the data (business networks, assets, participants, and transactions) is persisted into browser local storage.## Before you beginIn order to install {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Playground, you need the following software installed:- Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12- Docker Engine 17.03 or greater- Docker Compose 1.8 or greater*Please note:* If you've previously used {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Playground locally or {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} and wish to clear everything and start again, the following commands will delete any running containers and delete all downloaded images, (be careful if you're using other Docker images on your machine):```docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm -fdocker images -aq | xargs docker rmi -f```To run {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} and {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}, we recommend you have at least 4Gb of memory.---## Creating the containers and installing playground locally1. Pick a directory that you want to install into, then run the following command to download and start a {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} instance and {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Playground:        curl -sSL https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/install-hlfv1.sh | bash2. Access your local {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Playground by clicking this link: http://localhost:8080. *Please note*: Private browsing is not supported when running the Playground locally.---## What's next?* Take a tutorial on using Playground, and try [our Playground tutorial](../tutorials/playground-guide.html).",

The easiest way to create the REST API is to use the `composer-rest-server` to dynamically generate a REST API from the deployed business network.In addition the `yo hyperledger-composer` command can be used to generate a skeleton Angular project that calls the `composer-rest-server` to interact with a business network.Please follow the Developer Guide for an example of how to use the `composer-rest-server` and the Angular generator.## References* [**Developer Guide**](../tutorials/developer-guide.html)* [**Composer REST Server**](../integrating/getting-started-rest-api.html)",
